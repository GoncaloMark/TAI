"We should keep the Electoral College for a number of reasons. While it is usually thought of as ""out of place"", it is the fairest method in voting for our President. The Electoral College, first, the outcome of the Electoral vote is less likely to cause a dispute than the popular vote. Second, avoids the problem of Runoff Elections. Last, the Electoral College helps balance the political weight for large states by population. We need the Electoral College so not create any problems."
"The outcome of the Electoral College vote is less likely to cause a dispute than the popular vote. The number of electoral votes a candidate gets usually exceeds his popular vote. For example, ""Obama received 61.7 percent of the electoral vote compared to only 51.3 percent on the popular votes cast for him and Rodney."" Since most of the states have a ""winnertakeall"" system, it's easier to determine which candidate gets the electoral vote if there is a plurality in the state. A tie in the electoral vote is possible, but not very likely, even if the total is an even number. Voting based on the popular vote would just cause more problems than we would like to deal with."
"Runoff Elections are avoided because of the Electoral College. Runoff elections are elections that are caused when neither candidate receives a majority of the votes given. As the article states, ""Nixon in 1968 and Clinton in 1992 both had only 43 percent plurality of the popular votes, while winning a majority in the Electoral College 301 and 370 Electoral Votes"". The Electoral College clearly shows who win without any complications that would create pressure for runoff Elections. We are received of this pressure because we have the Electoral College."
"Finally, the Electoral College helps balance the weight that large states lose because I urge this country to continue with the Electoral College as it always has! There may be better methods out there, but the Electoral College is the best system we have right now."
"Limiting car usage can actually be effective belief it or not. While limiting your car usage you would be saving money, getting more exercise, and not polluting your environment as much as before."
"Limiting your car usage is beneficial because you could potentially save a lot of money. Every time you need to put more gas in the car that's fifty dollars down the drain. Saving fifty dollars a week actually adds up very rapidly and be used on something you will enjoy. Instead of buying gas you can go to the movies with friends, go ice skating or even out for dinner. Money is an important role in our economy today and spending a large amount on transportation regularly doesn't sound proper. Having more money is something I'm sure everybody would enjoy, especially not wasting it on gas money."
Not using your car is also beneficial because you can get more exercise by walking or riding your bike where you need to go. Exercising is something everybody needs to do to maintain a healthy lifestyle and also staying active. Instead of driving your car park in your garage on go for a nice relaxing bike ride. And if you don't have a bike go for a walk. People every day are getting bigger and bigger and don't realize how important exercise really is.
Every time you use your car it harms the environment. When you start your car..... Pollution. I believe someday were going to have so many cars that all the fumes and smoke will blur our vision when driving. During a point in time we won't be able to breath all the fumes because how strong they will be.
Not using your car is beneficial to both the environment and you. So next time you want to go out park the car and go for a walk.  
"Dear Principal,"
"After school or during school activities like basketball, soccer, volleyball, track, wrestling and others, are basically what kids want. Taking that privilege away can hurt them not only emotionally, but physically as well. Kids are very active, hyper and full of energy. Running it off will cool them down, and make them feel good about themselves as a person."
"A B average is a lot to ask for in a student. Especially the one who can hardly get a C average, which is passing. If C is a passing grade, why higher the expectation? You can even graduate from high school with straight D's. If you can graduate with D's, what's so wrong with a C? They're not the greatest grade you can get, but it's most definitely passing."
"Some kids might even only want to go to school for sports. Because you can do something you love, and maybe even get a scholarship for it. If you practice hard enough and get good at it, you can achieve it. Taking this away from students won't help at all, it can actually possible make things worse for not just one student, but multiple. Some parents might even count on their kids to get a scholarship for a sport, because they struggle academically. Or maybe, just because their parents played sports."
"Canceling sports for people who may ""academically struggle"" [not getting a B average], is pointless. If you as a child loved something, let's say a sport. If school was the only place you could play that sport, then it was all of a sudden canceled. How would you feel? Wouldn't you feel kind of bummed? I think so. That's how everyone who plays sports feel. Maybe it's for the better, maybe not. Maybe it will encourage the students to give extra effort to their grades, maybe it won't."
"With whatever you do, think of how many students do get a B average. Good for them, they'll get to be able to stay in that activity, no worries for them. But then, think of all the students who don't. Good luck with your choice, hope it works out for the best."
"Sincerely,"

"Many people think that aliens are real, but they're not! Many people believe that this photo is caused by aliens. They don't know the true story of this and that it has to be caused by natural landform. There's no proof that aliens are real and no one really proved it at all! People just assume that it's caused by aliens because they see a big hole, but it's a natural landform. Until I see proof that aliens are real then I will believe them, but right now there is no proof at all."
"Many people think that it's caused by aliens, but it's not. It even said, ""NASA unveiled the image for all to see. The caption noted a ""huge rock formation."" It may look like a face, but that's just how it is. Conspiracy theorists don't even know what they're talking about. They just assume things, but they never show proof. NASA even showed proof that it's not caused by alien, but it may look like it was caused by aliens. It's just a natural landform."
"Many people waited to see if the natural landform was actually caused by aliens. JPL revealed that it was a natural landform and that there was no alien monument after all. Many people still believe that it's caused by aliens and people even showed proof that it's not caused by aliens. Not everyone was satisfied that it was a natural landform because, ""The camera on board MGS had to peer through wispy clouds to see the face."" There really hasn't been a single one proof that aliens actually exist."
"Although, the natural landform does look like an alien, but that's just how the natural landform is. The picture was actually showing us a butte or mesa, which is a landform that is common around the American West. So, this is common here, in the Earth, so this has to be common in Mars. They even said, ""That's a lava dome that takes the form of an isolated mesa about the same height as the Face on Mars."" So, it was provened to be a mesa."
"Many people thought that this picture was to be an alien. Many people, including NASA, even showed proof that it wasn't an alien. NASA at first did think that it was an alien, until they showed us proof of what they researched. People even showed us proof that it was just mesa, which is common to happen. It may look like it was caused by an alien, but it was just a natural landform that looks like an alien."
I think if a student has a C average he or she may not be able to participate in sports or in other activities is not much of good idea because I know that in this school out hundreds of students there might only be like from ten to twenty students that has nothing but A's and B's in their report card.
So imagine you do change the policy so that students may be able to participate in sports or other activities there will only be like twenty or maybe less students going to those activities for example me I have never gotten only A's and B's in my report card I always get like only one A three B's and the rest C's but I have never gotten an F or D or else my parents take all my privileges like my Xbox the TV or the computer.
"There was this on time when I got an F in my report card I got an F on math class I didn't want to show the report card to my parents, but eventually they found out when I got home my dad asked me"" where's the report card?"" and I said the teacher hasn't given us the report card he said your lying because the school called me and told me they gave you the report card"
"Many technological improvements in the field of education are being made every day. There are constantly new and exciting ways to educate and teach students each and every year. However, behind all of that technology there must still be a competent teacher/instructor there in order to fully teach the material. The use of the Facial Action Coding System in classrooms is not valuable because it lets teachers not engage as much with students, is not necessary for a successful learning environment, and would be too complicated and powerful for most computers to be realistically implemented throughout the country."
"While technology can definitely assist in giving students a worthwhile academic experience, there still must be a competent and engaged teacher past it in order for students to truly learn. With more and more advancements being made, it gives teachers and instructors less and less responsibility and obligation to teach properly and effectively. While some may argue that a human instructor is not necessary for students to learn, it is still more beneficial for a fellow human being to convey the lessons being taught alongside the technology than just the technology teaching. In the article, the doctor who helped develop the technology states ""''...it could modify the lesson, like an effective human instructor.'"" This quote shows that this technology could essentially take over a lot of aspects of a teacher's job, giving the teacher less of an obligation to teach their students. Human instructors are important for people to learn material effectively, so they must be given a certain amount of responsibility in order for there to be a good learning environment."
"While this technology could theoretically be beneficial for students, it is not an essential aspect needed for a successful learning environment. The article talks about how this technology can assess people's emotions similarly to how people do in person every day. In the article, the doctor who helped develop the software says ""'A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored.'"" This could be a helpful tool in certain scenarios, but as the article mentions, humans do this process naturally throughout the day and while we cannot assess as accurately as a computer could, we can still sense the general emotion of someone. This makes the face analyzing technology a possibly beneficial tool, but an unnecessary and unrealistic tool as well."
"Even if this technology were an absolutely essential part of every classroom, at this point in time it is not realistic to expect it to be implemented effectively. This software is relatively new and is powerful, so an expensive and powerful computer must be used in order to utilize it well. In the article, the author states that ""Your home PC cant handle the complex algorithms used to decode Mona Lists smile."" This quote implies that most PC's currently available to people would not be capable of using the software. Even if most schools could acquire the powerful computers needed to run this software, it would take a serious and detrimental chunk of funding away from other more important school aspects such as lunches or libraries. Even though the technology can be helpful in certain instances, it is not realistic to expect schools to be able to implement it anytime soon."
"The Facial Action Coding System is a promising new technology, and as such has its fair share of issues. While seemingly impressive and futuristic at first glacé, once one begins to take into account other factors the system starts to become more of an interesting novelty than a breaking new education tool to be used in classrooms across the globe. New developments often bring improvement with them, but before being implemented must be tweaked and carefully considered in order to be successful. In around a decade, this facial reading software could be a typical sight in many classrooms. But as it stands now, it has too many flaws and issues in order to be taken seriously."

"Operating a cellular device at the same time as handling a vehicle is so dangerous, due to texting and driving becoming the leading cause of death among teenage drivers, one out of every four car accidents in the U.S. is caused by texting and driving, that boils down to roughly eight people being killed each day and roughly one thousand one hundred and sixty-one injuries in crashes that involved distracted driving."
"Texting and driving appears to be a significant problem among young drivers. Studies show that drivers on a mobile phone reduce their visual scanning of the road ahead, are more likely to weave within their lane on bends, and are slower to respond to hazards. It is important to go ahead and deal with this issue for young adults now, so that they can break this habit and not have to deal with any future issues."
"Due to the constant concern of this matter, many states have decided to enforce a hands-free law. The different stats in the United States that have enforced this law are, California, Connecticut, Delaware, Georgia, Hawaii, Illinois, Maryland, Nevada, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, Oregon, Vermont, Washington, West Virginia plus Washington, D.C."
"Laws and facts show several reasons why it is unsafe to text and drive, but when it narrows down, the driver must take under consideration the different situations that can affect them self and others in the vehicle as well. Younger drivers do not realize the importance of considering the passengers, other motorists, or pedestrians, there are so many things that can happen around a moving vehicle, and just the slightest move can have the worse outcome for everyone."
"Although there are certain laws about the matter, most drivers either avoid the law or do not fully understand the importance of it. There are other ways to get through to someone about this matter, such as, telling someone about how uncomfortable it is, or how risky it can be, another way is just simply taking the phone from them."
"In conclusion, driving while on a phone is something that should be strictly advised against, the next time someone gets in a vehicle and is preparing to drive away, they should think to themselves about what could happen if they acknowledge the little device in their lap, think more responsibly and get to the destination safely.  "
"Dear state senator,"
"With so many opinions on the electoral college, there's reasons in which to keep it or abolish it."
"I would like a favor in keeping The Electoral College because it's an election of the president by vote in congress and election of the president by a popular vote of qualified citizens."" The Electoral College process consists of the selection of the electors, the meeting of the electors where they vote for President and Vice President, and the counting of the electoral votes by congress(Source 1,2). Without The Electoral College everything will fail due to the fact that the college does all the voting and picking and deciding if not the Electoral College then who else will do it; All the other congressmen has to do their own job in which they can't do what The Electoral College does. The Electoral College has been in place for a while The founding fathers created it. Its consists of 538 electors. There are disadvantages to like voters don't vote for the president, but for a slate elector, who votes for the president. At the most basic level, the electoral college is unfair to voters. But then there's advantages"" The Electoral College is widely regarded as an anachronism, a non-democratic method of selecting a president that ought to be by declaring the candidate who receives the most popular votes the winner. The advocates of this position are correct in arguing that the Electoral College method is not democratic in a modern sense. It is the electors who elect the president, not the people(source 3). When you vote for a presidential candidate you're actually voting for a slate of electors. People have their own opinions but I think it would be better to keep the traditional going on keeping the electoral college."

Phones & Driving
"In the present times, many people all over the world use their cellular devices either for activity planning, work related tasks, or some time to relax. Phones in this generation are considered an addiction to our lives and is in a way dangerous because of how easily we get distracted on to them even in times when we shouldn't be on them. When driving, all senses and attention is needed because an accident can come at you from anywhere, when you least expect it. Does texting and driving cause traffic accidents? When you lose focus doing something that requires attention give it full attention with no distractions because you or others could end up getting hurt."
"Driving is an action that does indeed require utmost attention when doing it, especially around other people. Distractions will get in the way when driving and ignoring it is the best course of action. Trying to drive can be difficult for some, and it's understandable but those who do know how to drive still can cause car accidents do to lack of focus when driving which is why laws to prevent phone usage while driving have been put down and enforced by police to keep others and ourselves safe from car accidents."
"Cell phones were created for fast communication and to help us react fast if there was trouble, or we were put in dangerous situations to get help as quickly as possible. Over the years, cell phones have evolved to be able to help us in our daily lives. An example would be reminders for occasions, calls from or to work/ video chat calls for face to face meetings if necessary, quick information gathering, and many more uses. The mobile era is riding strong and doesn't look like it's gonna fall for a while with many apps developed that can be downloaded and used on our phones from social media apps to learning ones. The use of phones has changed the lives of many to the best or worst occasions, meaning that phones are good for us only at certain times, not all the time."
"The fact of the matter is that phones are useful but can cause harm to us and others like health problems, mental problems, and tear what we call fun. Driving is needed for moving around quickly if you're not feeling like taking public transportation to get to your location. Both the cell phone and motor vehicle were made to make our lives easier in the new era, but putting both together can cause issues and hurt yourself and others. Thinking of times without these tools' life was a little rough and harder to keep up with, meaning that staying updated on friends and family or trying to get from place to place."
"Overall, the people know what's right from wrong and when to do something at the right time. Does texting and driving cause traffic accidents? The blame goes to those who don't abuse the technology of the new generation like Bluetooth devices, speakerphones in the car, and smartwatches. The laws that help and try to prevent people from harm do their best, but the people need to contribute to helping each other. Driving and texting should be done separately to prevent accidents and just live life, while be safe from yourself and others.  "
"For over thirty years, the question about the Face on Mars has been posed; alien life or natural landform? Although scientists have been grilled by the media, there is only truly evidence that the Face is a natural landform, much like a butte or mesa, landforms common around the American west, despite what conspiracy theorists have to say."
"NASA's Viking 1 first photographed the formation in 1976, the formation described as ""An enormous head nearly two miles from end to end."""
"When NASA revealed the image to the public a few days later, claims of alien life began surfacing. The article 'Unmasking the Face on Mars' stated that ""The face on Mars had since become a pop icon. It has starred in a Hollywood film, appeared in books, magazines, radio talk howsoever haunted grocery store checkout lines for 25 years! Some people think the Face is bona fide evidence of life on Marsevidence that NASA would rather hide, say conspiracy theorists. Meanwhile, defenders of the NASA budget wish there was an ancient civilization on Mars."" The media blew up at the idea of the Face being signs of intelligent life forms on other planets, despite what the scientists had to say about what the face truly was."
"Eighteen years after the Viking missions ended, the Mars Global Surveyor flew over Colonia for the first time (Colonia is the area of Mars where the face was discovered) a Mars orbiter team snapped a picture ten times sharper than the original Viking photos. The photos revealed a natural landform, not an alien monument at all. On April 5, 1998, the Mars Global Surveyor flew over Colonia on a cloudless summers day, managing to get close enough for the Mars orbiting team to capture an extraordinary photo using the cameras absolute maximum resolution. Each pixel in the 2001 image spans 1.56 meters, compared to 43 meters per pixel in the best 1976 Viking photo."
"Jim Gavin, chief scientist of NASA's exploration program says was a rule of thumb, you can discern things in a digital image 3 times bigger than the pixel size,  he added. so, if there were objects in this picture like airplanes on the ground or Egyptian-style pyramids or even small shacks, you could see what they were! The picture of the Face is actually showing the Martin equivalent of a butte or mesa-landforms common around the American West. it reminds me most of Middle Butte in the Snake River Plain of Idaho."" Says Gavin. ""That a lava dome that takes the form of an isolated mesa about the same height as the Face on Mars."
"Despite what the media has to say about the Face on Mars, it is nothing more than a natural landform. Ever since NASA released the images, they have been under a magnifying glass. Conspiracy theorists have claimed that the face is anything but a natural land mass, evidence of aliens, yet the scientists at NASA have time and time again proven them wrong. As we explore the great unknown, we stumble onto unfamiliar and strange things and ideas. As exciting as an alien monument would be, the face is nothing more than a natural landform on the great red planet."
"Source: ""Unmasking the Face on Mars"", May 24, 2001 (retrieved from science. Nasa. Gov/science-news/science-at-nasa/2001/ast24may_1/)"
"Don't some things sound too good to be true? Well, this is one of many. NASA scientists have found a ""face"" on Mars. This has been solved to be just a landform, but some people still believe that the ""face"", was created by aliens. Here are some facts to prove that this is a natural landform."
"First of, in 1976, pictures were not the best back then. We were still working on them to make the outcome look better. With the digital images being 3 times bigger than the pixels, you are bound to find something that is not what it seems to be. Also, the ""face"" is located 41 degrees north martian latitude. This is a more foggy area of the planet. This could explain why the picture looks like a ""face"". Also, there were other objects around the ""face"" that cast shadows on the landform, making it look like it has eyes, a nose, and a mouth. This landform is very similar to landforms in the West of the U.S. This would be called a mesa. Finally, the scans of the ""face"" can only go so far. Plus, the camera doesn't go over the face often either."
"Even since cameras have been upgraded for a better picture, NASA can prove that this is not an alien made ""face"", but a natural landform on Mars. "
"The article ""Driverless Cars Are Coming"" display both positive and negative aspects about driverless cars. Everyone looks forward to the feature because of new technology that could make life easier but we really don't think about the bad that can come from these new devices. In my personal opinion I think that the negative aspects outweigh the positive aspects when it comes to driverless cars."
"Even though driverless cars can possibly be good for the economy because they use half the fuel of today's taxis they also have a large amount of cons that many people don't ever think about because they are blinded by the fact that these cars can basically get you where you need to go with little to no assistance from you, the manual driver. Even though driverless cars can get you where you need to go with hardly no assistance from you there will also be times when they do need your assistance, like if there is an accident or when there are road closes ahead. Although the car can alert you will you be to distracted by other things, such as cell phones, to pay attention to the signals that the car is giving you? Many drivers are probably more likely to get bored while they are waiting for their turn to drive and this can result in accidents or something of that nature became you, the distracted driver, has missed the warning signals that the car is giving off to you."
"Also people look at the aspect that just because they might be saving money by getting these cars because they will save money on gas and think that they are getting a better deal. But however, these cars are basically computer cars and if there is a problem with electrical pieces in the car it could be very pricey. Also since these cars are basically ran off of these computers that means of a part if messed up TH car will not function properly."
"Even though these cars can possibly be safer for the public when it comes to drunk drivers, what if these cars have a malfunction or technical diffuclitys? That could also be very harming to the public and you. If these driverless cars have a malfunction it could also put your life in danger along with the other people around you."
"In conclusion, driverless cars has its pros and cons but when you actually think about it, the cons outweigh the pros. Just because you have this driverless car does not make you any more safer than a person with a non-driverless car. Just like regular cars, driverless cars has cons to it as well. Driverless car scan have expensive repairs and malfunctions just like regular cars can have. In my opinion driverless cars can have just as big of a risk as regular cars do. "
"Many Students dread waking up extremely early every morning to go to school. Some schools have found an alternative for these students by offering distance learning as an option for students to attend classes from home by way of online. Students would benefit from being able to attend classes from home because it allows them to receive extra help, to learn in a comfortable environment, and to have more free time."
"Attending classes online allows students to access help from online teachers and students more easily. By using online classes, students can ask the teacher as many questions as they need without being nervous of other students' opinions. Many students are anxious to raise their hands in school in fear of embarrassment. Younger generations feel very comfortable communicating with others online, so students could ask each other for help too. Video conferencing with teachers also allows one on one help. Teachers can spend more time with a student by giving them extra practice on a topic the student may struggle with. The method of face to face communication through video conferencing provides the same benefits as communicating with a teacher at school. This allows students to thoroughly understand subjects from home."
"Learning in a comfortable environment is a major key in education. If students are in the comfort of their own home, whether it's sitting on the couch or laying in bed, they are more likely to retain the information learned during class. They can even wake up and participate in classes while still in their pajamas. It is much easier to sit through lectures and participate in class while being comfortable instead of sitting in a sturdy, uncomfortable desk at school. Students do not have to worry about their appearance while using online school. This allows students to roll out of bed and participate in class without worrying about immediately brushing their teeth, taking a shower, or putting on presentable clothes. It also allows kids to participate in class even when they are sick. Learning from home gives students the ability to learn in an environment they feel safe and comfortable in to maximize their education experience."
"Many students struggle to find time for extracurricular activities because of school. Online classes opens up more time for students to participate in extracurricular activities such as sports or clubs. Class schedules can be flexible to fit each student's own schedule. This will help balance their school and personal life and reduce stress. A current major issue many students face while in school is the lack of sleep they get. By attending classes from home, students can obtain extra needed sleep. Individuals will function and perform at their highest ability every day by getting the required amount of sleep. Every person is different, so attending classes at home can help students balance school and their own personal interests."
"Distance learning allows a lot of benefits for students by taking classes at home. This allows them to obtain extra help, to learn in a safe and comfortable area, and to have more time for their own personal interests. Some students may prefer traditional schooling, however, it is clear that attending classes from home is the best path for many students."
"It is a vote qualified by the citizen and the founding fathers established it in the constitution. all the votes have to go to the electors and to the congress, and then they pick the president and the vice president. The election is held every four years on the same month and day. The governor lists all the people who ran for president in your state."
The winner takes all system that awards all electors to the winning presidential candidate. The governor prepares a certificate of ascertainment. The certificate of ascertainment also declares the winning presidential candidate in your state and shows which electors are representing your state. The 60 percent of the voters would prefer a direct election to the kind we have now.
"You would have to vote for a slate if you want to vote for John Kerry. Not always do the voters control whom their electors vote for. Seventeen states didn't see the candidates at all, including Rhode Island and South Carolina. But each party selects a slate of electors trusted to vote for the party's nominee. In a state creates a landslide electoral-vote victory in that state."
The popular vote was really close in Florida in 2012.
There are advantages and disadvantages of not being able to drive a vehicle place to place. Many people do not agree with this change in society because it makes getting around more difficult. But on the other hand if you get to thinking about if it is healthier for the environment and yourself. To get more into detail let me continue...
"Who likes to walk? Most people would say I hate walking, but now they have no choice or else they will pay the price. You could take the chance of driving, if you want to pay $40,000 just for a parking space!!! In source one they explain that because of the high fine and parking rates over 70 percent of Vauban's families do not own cars and 50 percent sold tar cars just move there... It was different in Paris, people were only allowed to drive their cars on a specific day according to their tag numbers. Paris is smog house of all the European capitals. To avoid traffic jams and smog Colombia started the ""car free day"" which is when citizens can only take the bus or a taxi to work or where they needed to get."
President Obama has a goal to stop the greenhouse gas emission. Officials state that each year the amount of cars being sold has decreased drastically along with the amount of licenses given. My opinion for the cause of this is because teenagers would rather be with friends going out to parties but can't drive home alone so they carpool. Maybe that's not the case maybe it's the increase in gas cost. Why should you waste gas instead of just going along with someone else.
"Some people believe it or not may not drive because they want to get into shape instead of being lazy and driving. Air pollution may have a big partake in the decreasing rates of driving, all you hear on the news is about the world ended new diseases what's next the ozone layer being eaten away by the chemicals given off by cars. It may not seem like a big deal now but that's what everyone says until it actually happens, and you have nowhere to hide. There's not much anyone could do to completely stop air pollution but if everyone obeys the rules set in certain parts of the world the environment would be a much better place to live in. So next time you want to go out cruise look at the big picture before thinking about the fun! It may seem like a good idea at first but there's always a reaction that comes unexpectedly."
"Some schools offer distance learning as an option for students to attend classes from home, basically online classes. I think students would benefit from having online classes from home, because, students would get more done at home then a student who goes to school for eight hours a day, and students would have more time to themselves, and it would really benefit students more, because students could get a full time job, and still get their school work done on time."
"Students will benefit from having online classes from home, because, once students have gotten their work done. The students can basically do anything they desire, like, go on a walk to the park, go bike riding with the students friends, out to eat with their family, etc. Students get more of their work done this way, by simply having online classes from their homes. Students would most likely be less stressed out, if the students had online classes from home, to some students getting up early in the morning can be a struggle, also having to stay up late night doing homework can cause the student to have depression, or get drained simply by going to school and having to stay up late night doing homework and studying."
"It would give the students more time to themselves, students could basically get up around nine in the morning, eat some breakfast, clean their room up a little, and by the time it is ten in the morning, the students would already be working on their online classes, in my opinion the online classes does not take very long. Mainly like three hours top. It would give basically the students, the rest of the afternoon to do anything they desire to do."
"The benefit of having online classes from home, could really help the students out, the students could get a full time job, and still get their online classes done before or after work, as long as the students clock in the hours for their online classes, and they would be on top of everything, possibly even be happier this way. It would not take a lot out of their day, as much as a student who has to attend school for eight hours, and go to work for another five hours, and having to come home and get in the shower, and still having to stay up late night getting homework done, and studying for a test, only getting four hours of sleep and having to get up at seven and be at school by eight. It could cause depression to a lot of young adults our age, especially students in high school, and college."
"In conclusion, having online classes from home, will benefit a lot of young students, because, students get way more done by having online classes, students have more time to themselves, unlike students who attend school for eight hours a day, seven days a week, and students could even get a full time job and still clock in the hours for their online school. More schools should give the students the opinion of taking online classes from their home, it would really help the students out a lot. "
"Students use cell phones all the time. They use it for calling a friend, as a calculator, it's also used for information through the internet. Cell phones can also bother other people that are working. That's why you should use it in places that aren't crowded with people working or reading. Cell phone can help kids do homework. Cell phones should be allowed in schools."
"A cell phone is a system that helps you communicate with other people. They are wireless, and you use them by pressing a specific number, it depends on who you are calling, and then put it between your ear and mouth. They are now coming with video chat and internet access. Cell phones are a great tool of communicating."
"Cell phones have a lot of advantages. They can help with their homework by providing information. If an incident happened, people can use cell phones to call 911. If a parent has a change of plans and can tell their kid they have to call the office. If the cell phones were allowed in school they could just text their child and not bother anyone. Cell phones are a good help for kids and adults."
They also have some disadvantage. They could distract a teacher if it rings in the middle of the class. But that wouldn't happen if the kids use it properly. They can also distract a student if the kid had video games in it. Which can also not happen if the kids use it the proper way. Cell phones have advantages and disadvantages.
"Cell phones are a great help for students, teachers and adults. They just keep getting better and so will technology. In the future the kids could be able to have cell phones in school. Who knows if the schools start letting kids bring cell phones to school. Cell phones are the new generation, and they will always be."
"Imagine it's 1976 and NASA reveals an interesting photo looking down upon Martian landscape. The photo catches your eye as it contains what appears to be a giant face made of rock coming out of the sand. NASA states that the ""face"" is a huge rock formation that resembles a human head formed by shadows giving the illusion of eyes, nose, and a mouth. But you also hear other people saying that the face is an ancient alien artifact! What do you believe? Pop culture quickly jumps on the idea of aliens because that view point is exciting. Meanwhile, NASA is a government backed and very credible source. I say that the educated person would listed NASA. I believe that the ""face on Mars"" is just another natural landform because the face looks just like a butte or mesa does on Earth, NASA's powerful cameras haven't captured anything alien looking on near the face, and because the majority of NASA and other credible scientists don't believe that the face is alien."
"According to the article Martian mesas are common around Colonia, the area where the famous picture of the face was taken. There is nothing unusual or different about this specific mesa except the shadows on top of it. These shadows give the illusion of eyes, nose, and a mouth. Mesas and buttes are landforms that are also very common on Earth around the American West. The Middle Butte in Idaho is a isolated mesa about the same height as the Face on Mars. I'm sure if pyramids started being discovered on the surface of Mars that's one thing, but just a single mesa that looks a bit like a face is no reason to immediately blame aliens."
"Another reason why the face is just a natural landform is because we have seen proof that is nothing but a landform. On April 8, 2001, which was a cloudless day in Colonia, another picture of the face was taken with a very powerful camera that used its maximum resolution for the picture. When you look at this picture it is almost hard to imagine a face even being there! The illusion of a nose, eyes, and a mouth is gone. All that remains in this picture are some cracks and rough edges on the rock structure. To many seeing is believing and this picture has allowed many to see the truth that the ""face on Mars"" is nothing but a myth."
"Some supporters of the idea that the structure was created by aliens argue that NASA is hiding more evidence and Malay even distorting images that point to the face being built by aliens. This is wrong because alien civilizations would increase NASA's funds and popularity. Also, it would be almost impossible to keep an alien secret from the public with so many employees knowing. These examples show why the ""face on Mars"" is just another natural land formation."
"Cars have been a part of our culture for some time now. Since Henry Ford created the Model T, we have been crazy about these machines. Molding, crafting, and improving since, we have come to know these as daily objects. However, with all the new and progressing theories now, is there really a need for cars? Limiting car use cold be beneficial not only for the Earth, but also for people. Limiting car use can improve people's moods, can reduce pollution, and improve community interaction."
"Firstly, limiting car use could in turn improve people's moods. In Vauban, Germany, there has been an experiment of great proportion. They are living a suburban life without cars. Not only is this community close and in touch, the people are happier. As mother of two Hadron Walter stated, ""When I had a car in was always tense. I'm much happier this way,"" it is showing that not having a car can really relax a person. Just think about it, no insurance, no car payment, no thinking if will my car last until the end of today, just saving thousands a year and having a lot of stress put off."
"Secondly, limiting car use can reduce pollution. I'm almost certain we've all heard about Global Warming and Greenhouse Gases, and the devastation they do to our planet. Without cars these problems are still present, but lack the massive numbers in which it was rising. Smog is a horrible kind of pollution that affects the biggest cities through the world. Paris banned cars for an entire day to remove the amount of smog in the area. This shows that pollution can be stopped. Even though they only banned even numbered license plates one day and odd another pollution still went down. If all cars were banned then pollution would have gone down even further."
"Lastly, limiting car use can improve community interaction. People now don't need cars for everything. They can walk, and take trains, and carpool. All these interactions strengthen the community. Walking makes people maybe want to buy things from stores along the way and help local stores. Taking trains can create friendships and long-lasting personal businesses. Carpooling city down on emissions and reduces pollution. The community can do nothing but benefit from these."
"In conclusion, limiting car use could be extremely helpful. It could improve people's moods, reduce pollution, and improve community interaction. Maybe someday we could actually get rid of cars and listen to the grinding of the pedals down the biking highways."
"Being assigned President of the United States is a very big deal, especially to the millions of people that live in this god blessed country."
"here United States of America has had different presidents ever since the beginning of this country. These presidents are not in it for the money, but they are holding the title"
"President"""
"Because these people want what is right for this country. But, how do we pick who gets to be president? It all comes down to the electoral college. Citizens of the United States are allowed to vote at the age of 18, these votes are said to mean so much, but that isn't always the case. It really all comes down to the number of electoral votes. Why make all these citizens vote, when the outcome might not even follow along with these votes."
"There are two types of votes. The electoral college votes, and the popular votes which is the number of citizens who voted for one certain candidate. However there has been times when the popular vote did not win the election. In 2000, candidate Gore had more of the popular votes then Bush did, but Bush had the most electoral votes. Shouldn't the citizens of this country be the ones who get to determine who the President is? I mean the President has a big duty and the citizens rely on His/Hers duty as president to keep things going right. The President can make huge decisions that affect these citizens which can make things horribly wrong or amazingly right."
"Yes, I know the people in the electoral college are super smart geniuses that know what they are doing, but? This is the country I live in, this is the country I was raised in, this is the country I love and am so blessed to be. I deserve to be able to pick the president I want, or at least have my vote be the reason the president I was rooting for wins. Us fellow citizens of the United States only want what's best for us. We may not be as smart as the people in the electoral college, but that sure won't stop us from knowing who we like and who we think is better for our country. We deserve as much right to have our own president as much as anyone in the electoral college does."
"This God blessed country is home to millions, it might not be perfect, but it is the greatest country in the world. The people who get the amazing benefit of living here deserve to be able to elect the President they want. These people want what they believe is best.  "
One place I would like to go visit in this world would be portico because it looks like a wonderful place to live in and because I want to experience how it is to live there or how school is for them. It might be a life changing for me to see how they live there maybe I might start being grateful for what I have and they don't and I would start helping others for often.
"One reason I would go to portico is to see how they do stuff different like what they wear, what they eat, and what they do on day it would be interesting seeing all that and I would like to try new food and wear the cloths they wear and try to see how it feels to be a Podgorica."
Another reason I would love to go to portico is because at the USA I am not grateful for what I have and maybe if is I go over to portico I will be grateful for what I have because I will see the difference of how I live and how they live it will also melt my heart to see them eating unhealthy and I am over here throwing my food away because i don't want it.
My final reason for wanting to go to portico is because I will want to see how their parents are with the kids like when they get in trouble. I also want to see how teachers are with their students when they get in trouble because I want to see if they are different from El Salvador cause there they hit their students with the ruler and that is not okay.
In conclusion I would like to see every difference they have from the USA and El Salvador and I want to try every food that they have and spend time with students. I want to be grateful of everything that I am able to have and they don't and maybe share the stuff that I have and they don't. Now I really want to go to portico and explore new stuff and have a nice adventure.
"As the author defends the claim that the exploration of Venus is a ""worthy pursuit,"" I, however, believe that this statement is not proven very efficiently. Although the author refers to NASA and the experiments they've carried out, the information just does not sufficiently back up the statement that Venus is a ""worthy pursuit despite the dangers it presents."" The author continuously describes the challenge it would be for humans to carry out the study of Venus from space, as well as using terms that convey the assumptions he or she is making based on his or her opinion. Many risks would be taken in order to physically explore Venus, so with this information in mind, I believe the author did not support the idea that studying Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers."
"In order for mankind to study the ""cloud-draped world,"" they would have to undergo much training to even be prepared to come near Venus and its harsh conditions. As stated in the text, the conditions on the planet are ""far more extreme than anything humans encounter on Earth."" Even with advanced technology that we have today, the article states that ""no spacecraft survived the landing for more than a few hours."" If the technology we have today can't even survive the conditions on Venus, how are humans supposed to be able to? Even though the author claims the conditions are ""not easy, but survivable for humans,"" the temperature can climb up to over 800 degrees Fahrenheit. These pieces of evidence from the excerpt convey the idea that Venus and its characteristics are far too dangerous for humans to even go near."
"In addition to Venus' extreme conditions, the challenge of collecting physical evidence from the planet would be extremely difficult as well. Even though humans could possibly hover 30 miles above the ground level, the texts states that the vast distance would provide only ""limited insight on ground conditions,"" and it would ""[render] standard forms of photography and videography ineffective."" Along with that, the author admits that ""researchers would not be able to take samples...from a distance."" The challenge that the study provides would simply not be worth the time, money, and risks. If man were to go to extreme lengths to reach within 30 miles of a planet and not be able to collect and evidence or data, it would not be a successful mission if the goal was to obtain new information about the planet."
"Moreover, the author's word choice contributes to the idea that his or her claim is not very well-supported. When examining the similarities between Earth and Venus, the author uses the word ""probably,"" saying that ""Venus was probably covered largely with oceans and could have supported various forms of life, just like Earth."" The word ""probably"" gives off the impression that the author is making an assumption about the fact that Venus could support life just like Earth based on a common feature between the two planets. It is dangerous to make assumptions about subjects such as this, because it would be very costly if it turned out to be incorrect in the end."
"After considering both sides of this controversial claim, I believe the author did not support the claim that studying Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers. Although the author referred to the study being beneficial to man's sense of imagination and innovation, it is simply just too dangerous. The author repeatedly describes the challenge it would be for humans to carry out the study of Venus from space, as well as word choice that conveys the assumptions he or she makes based on their own knowledge. Many risks would be taken in order to physically explore Venus, and I believe the dangers could be more costly than the knowledge gained through the experience. I believe the author did not support the idea that studying Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers. "
"Every once in a while, we all take a minute to look up at the bright sparkling stars. After a while, you begin to notice that one ""star"" in particular is brighter than the rest. That ""star"" is actually Venus. It's so close to Earth that we can actually see it. This intrigues many astronomers and other scientists because it triggers their curiosity. It brings much interest to many people such as the author of this passage. The author of this article suggest that studying Venus is a worth pursuit despite the dangers it presents."
"Although there are many dangers to studying Venus, there is also a plus side to it. If scientists can build a machine that allows us to get closer to objects on Venus, we could take them back to Earth (paragraph 7). If we could do this, it would help us gain more knowledge on the atmosphere and ground conditions of the planet and help scientists learn how to get humans closer to possibly getting to Venus one day. Human curiosity will likely lure us into many equally intimidating endeavors. For example, in the text it even talks about how far we have come with computers. Knowing this, we should take advantage of our curiosity. Imagination, and innovation. This would allow all people to have a better insight of Earth's twin planet, Venus."
"In conclusion, scientists have come a long way from the very beginning. Astronomers are inventing marvelous machines that last up to 3 weeks even in horrific weather condition simulators. Astronomers are looking at things in a whole new perspective and will one day make it to Venus. Although it's quite dangerous, the work will be a worthy pursuit in the end."
"People use them to commute around various locations, and it releases harmful emissions. The object that is being referred to is a car, a car is beneficial, but people should limit car usage because it cuts down on pollution of the atmosphere, and it is not as bad as it seems to not use a car all the time, and limiting usage of cars is starting to trend."
"Cars release green house gas emissions that affect the ozone layer of the atmosphere. That is a main cause as to why people should limit car usage. ""Congestion was down 60 percent in the capital of France, after five-days of intensifying smog...[the smog] rivaled Beijing, China, which is known as one of the most polluted cities in the world."" as explained in the article"
Paris bans driving due to smog. This shows that smog is caused a good amount by cars and has affected major cities around the world. It also showed that when less usage of cars happened there was a 60 percent decrease in congestion which is a big percentile. In paragraph 5 of the article
"In German Suburb, Life Goes On Without Cars."
"It is explaining that automobiles are a big part of the suburbs and is an effect on the efforts to try in cut down on green house emissions of cars. Its states in the article by Elisabeth Rosenthal, that ""passenger cars are responsible for 12 percent of green house emissions in Europe.... and up to 50 percent in some car-intensive areas in the United States. Some may argue that the percent of green house emissions produced by cars is not high, but in reality it is, and the numbers keep rising. If people limit the use of automobiles the numbers can be cut down and reduce pollution in areas that have heavy amounts of smog, smog affects the health of people and is toxic. ""After days of near-record pollution, Paris enforced a partial driving ban to clear the air of the global city."" as stated in the article"
Paris bans driving due to smog this shows that driving is a major contributor to smog and can be reduced by people limiting the usage of cars.
"Limiting car usage is not so bad and can even promote a happier lifestyle as shown in the articles about limiting driving. ""When I had a car I was always tense. I'm much happier this way,'' said a media trainer and a mother of two who's statement is said in the article"
"In German Suburb, Life Goes On Without Cars."
"This shows even when the people of the community of Vauban, Germany, experience a fortuitous lifestyle. '' Vauban, completed in 2006, is an example of a growing trend in Europe, the United States and elsewhere to separate suburban life from auto use, as a component of a move, ent called ""smart planning"" as stated in the article"
"In German Suburb, Life Goes On Without Cars."
"This shows that limiting car usage is a ""trend"" and it leads to a positive outcome that affects generations to come. People around the world are also taking up the movement of limiting car usage, in Bogota, Columbia a business man named Carlos Arturo said ''it's a good opportunity to take away stress and lower air pollution."" as referred to in the article"
"Car-free day is spinning into a big hit in Bogotá this shows that not only the advantages of limiting car usage is decrease in air pollution but can also benefit the individual. 'If the pattern persists-and many sociologists believe it will-it will have beneficial implications for carbon emissions and the environment."" as explained in the article"
The End Of Car Culture.
This is relating to the pattern of how in America the buying of cars is going down since 2005. Which as result of that occurring has benefited or will benefit the environment. This shows how more and more people are traveling less by car.
The advantages of limiting car use far outlay the disadvantages of not using a car. This means that people are during more to commute less by car and more by eco-friendly transportation like bikes. The limiting of car usage not only impact people now but will do so in the future of the world and if not changed will result in the mass pollution of the globe.
The use of the Facial Action Code System to read the minds of students is valuable in a classroom. There are many advantages that having this software used inside classrooms would bring. It make it more fun for both the students and the teacher.
"The Facial Action Code System could let the teachers know if the students in her class are confused about something or even bored. I think that students would be less likely to want to learn about something if It's nothing fun that is being associated with it. In paragraph 6 it stated that, "" A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored Dr. Huang predicts, Then it could modify the lesson"". I feel that would be effective in the classroom because if the computer were to see that the student wasn't learning or bored while its on it then it could change up the program so its made more interesting for the student and make them learn more."
I think that the use of the Facial Action Code System to read the minds of students would be valuable in a classroom. There are so many advantages that having this software used inside classrooms would bring to both students and teacher for example making learning fun for students I think it would make school fun for both the students and the teacher.  
"Some schools require students to complete summer projects to assure they continue learning during their break, but are unsure whether these tasks should be student-designed or teacher-designed. Psychologists have proven that in order for a person to actually remember information, that information needs to be repeatedly tested upon in order to remain significant in the brain. Summer break, as a huge gap in between learning periods, is massively disruptive to the cognitive process. Summer projects given over the break period should be moderately designed by the students themselves, because it gives the student control over their individual situation, it allows the student to express themselves creatively, and it removes pressure from school teachers; all while preparing them for life after school."
"Students in school are constantly coddled, both by their parents and by the teachers in their learning environment. Giving an individual the ability to plan and create their own project is teaching them how to manage tasks on their own. It allows them to take into account their schedule, their own situation. Teenagers in high school spread rapidly after the school season has ended. Some travel, or get jobs, or go to summer camps; while others prefer to stay rooted where they are comfortably. Giving students that ability to decide for themselves how they are going to carry through with working around those activities is necessity. It allows them room to breathe. Putting the responsibility of caring for their own needs in students' hands gives them the much-needed abilities they will need for later in life."
"Teenagers during the school year often don't get the opportunity to express themselves creatively and individually. Tasks designed during this time are teacher-designed and often follow a strict to-do list, which mushes everyone's work into one giant puddle of the same idea. Giving students the thumbs-up to style and create their own work assignment suddenly sets the bar way higher. Students are much more likely to branch out from the boring, black and white school project normally set by teachers. Difference in thought is an important concept that needs to be stressed to young people in society. No person is the same as any other. Setting an individual up for normality is setting them up for failure in the real world."
"Finally, putting control in the hands of students takes the pressure off of teachers to work all year round."
"Being constantly ailed with stress and work is definitely not beneficial for a persons' health. Teachers especially, who work in an environment surrounded by teen drama and the potential spread of sickness, need time off to recover. Forcing them to plan and grade massive projects during their supposed ""time off"" is unfair to them. During the school year, teachers often have no time to waste to spend with their own children, because they are so focused on having to grade those two-hundred papers for school. Giving teachers time away from the stress of other peoples' children gives them time to set aside for themselves and for their kids."
"Some people may claim that giving students the ability to design their own project is not ""giving"" but ""forcing"". Students may need guidelines in order to work properly and receive a fair grade for their effort. Or worst case, they simply won't do the work. If a student needs a step-by-step process on how to recount their learning, then how will they expect to fend for themselves once they graduate? During high school, students need this time to learn more than just history or math, they need to learn how to manage their own lives. Giving them the right to design their own project is the best decision for both students and teachers.  "
[Phones & Driving]
"Technology and driving are a very dangerous pair they have taken so many innocent lives because people's faces are glued to their phone. In 2016 263 teen's age's (16 to 19) were killed by distracted driving. The NHTSA estimates that every day 660,000 drivers use electronic devices while behind the wheel. That's a lot of lives at stake because people are careless and can't just pull their eyes away from their phone's just to drive down the street."
"In 2018 about 4,637 people died in car accidents related to distracted driving, by using cellphones. The technology of today has evolved or progressed to where there are so many new gadgets and apps that were constantly looking down at our screens. We also are always taking picture or videos while trying to drive and if you aren't recording yourself then you're probably trying to pose for the camera. Even when u don't like to drive and text or do whatever on your phone there are always going to be friends or family that encourage or want u to do something on your phone while driving. Out of all the crashes in the world 26% of those crashes are caused by texting and driving."
"My reason for writing this essay is to agree that talking or being on a device while driving is dangerous. Here I will list my reasons for it being dangerous. First off it puts yourself and other drivers in harm's way and possibly hurt badly or even killed. That's you should put your phone away when driving or do whatever you have to do on it before you get on the road. Secondly you should think about the consequences of you do it such as, if I do this will it harm me and my drivers, or people in the vehicle with me. Even if you are a cellphone addict you should think about others before you drive and text."
"So for the conclusion of my essay I will end it by saying this driving and text is a very bad way to hurt yourself and others on the road so if you care put down the phone, and put your eyes on the road. The world would be a safer place without people texting and driving and not paying attention to the road and their surroundings. We ask that the people that are texting and driving to please stop, because they are killing or are putting peoples children on the road in danger. I along with a bunch of other people feel distracted driving has to stop now.  "
"""CRASH!"" The driverless automobile hits another vehicle. The wreck is capable of being prevented if there is a driver in control. ""Driverless Cars Are Coming"" is an article that depicts driverless cars. The advanced vehicle is helpful in various situations, but it can also have its unfortunate moments. The invention is not supported. The independent automobile is in danger of a technical problem, and the possibility of someone being injured is very high. The new technology is expensive too, and frequent problems with the law can occur. The independent vehicle has many disadvantages."
"Driverless cars put everyone at an even higher risk of being injured or killed. There are not any natural instincts or feelings that can easily adapt to adversity. If the driverless automobile is confused, damage can possibly occur. ""For starters, they needed a lot of sensors,"" is a quote that displays the importance of human feelings and reactions. ""The combination of all this input is necessary for the driverless car to mimic the skill of a human at the wheel,"" is another detail from the passage that shows the emotionless car's disadvantage. The advanced automobiles do not have instinct, intelligence, or reasoning of a human being."
"The driverless vehicle is also very expensive. There is no point in paying more money for this irrelevant toy when there are cheaper options. ""Radar was a device on a hilltop that cost two hundred million dollars. It wasn't something you could buy at Radio Shack,"" is a clear example of the necessary payments. ""These smart-road systems worked surprisingly well, but they required massive upgrades to existing roads, something that was simply too expensive to be practical,"" is another quote that depicts the financial aspects. The computer-driven cars cost too much money."
"Disputes with the law can occur. The driver and the manufacturer are mostly like going to get in many quarrels. ""If the technology fails and someone is injured, who is at fault-the driver or the manufacturer?"" is a question from the passage that explains the confusion. ""Still, even if traffic laws change, new laws will be needed in order to cover liability in the case of an accident,"" is a detail that also explains the uncertain responsibilities. Problems with the law are likely to happen."
The idea of driverless cars roaming around does not sound like a fantastic idea. Someone is at a higher risk of getting hurt. The modern invention is expensive; disputes are likely to happen with the law. People are capable of changing the world in a better and safer way. The creation of the driverless car is definitely not a way to improve the world.
"The technology that is being used to show what you are actually feeling in the picture is not a such bad idea, but it's also not something everyone would like to use. Many people might just not want to let know what is behind that ""Fake Smile"" people just don't really want their own expression to hurt other peoples feelings. This is the way I can think one example, say you take a picture with a celebrity that's maybe tired or real mad but still has to take a photo with you and make a fake smile. You wouldn't even know until you get home and check on the image to see what's behind that act and what's behind the image, thats when you get upset and find out about the trust because maybe it's not the moment that you wanted to capture in for that photo with a person you admire. Another example, we now know or think we know what Lisa was feeling behind that image, but nobody will eventually end up knowing the actual truth behind that. Anatomy is a great thing to know about because you are learning nearly Eva single thing about the body such as the muscles and the organs and all the small things body would have even known of before. Eventually technology could get so better as these generations change, people now know better ways of acting and making themself feel a way they might not want to feel but yet can lie to others. Not all cameras on a computer might be able to detect much from a face. What would be the point of doing all this research and finding ways to know what's behind an image. What are people now doing about the photo now that they ""Know"" what Mona Lisa was feeling. Will the be changes and speeches about what behind photos now? We also have to think about what other benefits could be pulled out from doing all of this new technology."
"If I were to one hundred percent agree to this then I would say that it would be amazing, to figure out what person is feeling because maybe you want to find out the truth about something for a serious work case. I just think that there are two ways someone could go in with this. So I would say that it's a good thing and a bad thing for this new technology to come to an end or to a better start. "
"The new technology called the Facial Action Coding System is very valuable. This new technology will be very useful in a classroom full of students that one teacher may not be able to handle all on their own. The Facial Action Coding System will help deal with many problems by reading a students face. This may help deal with situations a teacher can not figure out on their own. This software may be able to tell the teacher when the student is confused, upset, or even when the student is bored and needs a more interactive subject or way of learning."
"When a student is confused, they may not ask for help to a teacher. The child may be too shy or nervous to ask for a simple example or explanation. This software program will be helpful because it will be able to read the students confused face and tell a teacher that the student needs help. In the short story in paragraph six it states, ""most communication is nonverbal, including emotional communication."" This explains how not all people will use words to explain what they are feeling. These students may never speak up for themselves or have the courage to ask a question without the program being here to help deal with the children needs."
"The Facial Action Coding System will not only help with students life in the classroom, but it may also help with a students feelings deeper within. The software will be able to pick out the students who are very upset, and need to talk about their emotions to another person. If a student has a sad face in class, the program may be able to identify what is wrong with the child, and it could notify this information to a teacher or a well trusted adult. In paragraph five of this story it states, ""most of us would have trouble actually describing each facial trait that conveys happy, worried, etc."" By having this computer software, it could help out with a students mental emotional feelings as well."
"This program will also be very helpful in providing a fun learning environment for the students. In the middle of paragraph six it explains how a classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming bored. It also states that if you smile when a website advertisement pops up on the computer screen it will show more advertisements like that one. If a person frowns when this pops up, it will show a different, more appealing advertisement. This can be very useful in a classroom. It may make the students more interested in learning. The students might even be more excited to learn now, because the computer will know that the students happy facial expressions mean they are enjoying the type of way the program is teaching them."
"The new Facial Action Coding System will be extremely helpful in a classroom. The students will have a more positive learning environment with this software. The new technology will not only be able to help with a student mental emotions, but it will help them be in a happier state of learning. This new system be more helpful for the students and for the teachers. The Facial Action Coding System is exactly what a school should be using for an overall better work place."
Dear Mr. Principal
"The idea of making school policy that you have to have at least a grade average of a B is a good idea, but you would have more of your star players ineligible to play because of grades. Now if our school was known for its brains and not sports, then yes I would encourage this, but it's not. We are known for our sports winning state championships in all the sports we offer. Changing the eligibility level to having at least a B or better, could possibly shoot down every thing our school is known for and why people want to come to it and those who don't fear us in an athletic category. I believe though if you must make this a rule, then you have to get the ones who aren't as smart tutors or someone to help them get the grades to play their sport. For other activities the can see where having an eligibility grade of at least a B could be a good thing like ski club, that's something that you can do by yourself by the school provide"
"In conclusion, I believe that it could be a good idea if our school was known for its grades but because it's just the opposite, we need to keep the eligibility level at a C average to maintain our reputation to those outside of school and those who may be thinking of coming to our school."
"Sincerely,"

"Dear, Senator"
"The United States of America should change the voting of the president to popular vote. Popular vote gets to see what the citizens of the United States want not just the 538 electors. They should change it to popular vote because it gets to see what the people want, and we can't control who the electors vote for."
"The president should be picked by the people because whoever wins the presidency is in charge of us. In the passage ""What is the electoral college"" it says ""The electoral college consists of 538 electors"". That means 538 people get a say in whom they want the president to be not the many citizens. We all should get a vote because if the electors are the only ones who get to pick then the popular vote is useless."
"Another reason why we should use only popular vote is because the electors don't always choose the president that their state wants. There only been a couple incidents of this happening but it's possible. In the article""the indefensible electoral college:why even the best-laid defenses of the system are wrong"" it says ""Can voters control who their electors vote for? Not always"". That is saying that there's always a possibility that your electors does not vote for what the state wants. That's not right, so they should change it to popular vote."
"The citizens of the United States should have direct votes to the election of our presidents. That's why You should change to popular vote. We get to see what the citizens want, and we can't always trust our electors.  "
"Driverless cars are a relatively new concept in the automobile industry, and the benefits they offer could potentially decrease the risk in driving, especially given the inconsistency of drivers in today's world. While this is a tempting and seemingly perfect solution to reducing the number of car accidents, I do not support the idea of driverless cars."
"The author states in section four that, ""The combination of all of this input is necessary for the driverless car to mimic the skill of a human at the wheel"". While humans are not in any way perfect drivers, the natural instincts and reactions of a human behind the wheel are impossible to capture in the form of sensors, robots, or mechanics of any kind. In situations where unorthodox solutions are needed to remain in control of the car and keep from crashing, veteran drivers have the knowledge and experience to do so. Robots may have programs to react in certain situations, or to move out of the way if an object is coming towards the car at a rapid speed, but not all situations can be programmed. Robots simply cannot react the same ways humans do, which brings me to my next reason for not supporting driverless cars."
"Section eight of the passage focuses on the psychological aspects of driverless cars, and introduces THD idea of laziness and boredom in human nature. Later on, the author states that some manufacturers hope to address this problem by including entertainment in the cars to remedy this boredom. Bringing in car entertainment would only further distract the now obsolete human drivers from the road, which in the case of an emergency, could prove fatal to not only the driver, but the passengers in the car as well. The Google car mentioned in section 7 ""Announces when the driver should be prepared to take over"". If the human did not hear the car announce this, and the car was reverted to the drivers control, the driver might end up in a crash. If the driverless cars provide more distractions than are at hand in the world today, no matter if a human is driving or not, the human driving the car could end up dead along with the passengers of the car. If driverless cars do become a reality, human drivers may one day become obsolete."
"Today's world is focused heavily on transportation and getting from one point to the next. Driverless cars would fulfil this requirement, but without the help of human drivers. The more that driverless cars would develop and improve, the less and less amount of humans would know how to drive. While this does not seem like a major problem if driverless cars were a reality, but the malfunctioning of systems would prove to be chaotic. If there was a system wide problem with driverless cars, all the vehicles in use, malfunctioning or not, would have to be recalled and fixed, causing mass hysteria. Because of the loss of driving skills, nobody would know how to drive. Humans would be unable to travel places, go to work, or do recreational activities."
"Driverless cars may promote many benefits to humans seeking leisure and comfort while driving, but driverless cars could prove to create some very serious safety issues, especially on the busy roads of today's society."
"The education system is always trying to find new ways to improve how kids learn and how efficiently the kids learn. With the evolution of technology, it has given the education system new ways to improve how students learn and interact with their teachers or professors on a day-to-day basis. Schools are now beginning to teach classes online to students, and it may be more beneficial the one may think. Students can heavily benefit from online learning and attending classes from because, it can help students focus more on their learning, it can allow teachers to be more available for their students, and it can help those that don't live close enough to an actual school still get an education."
"Online classes and learning from home can help students focus and buckle down on their education. For example, Generic_Name is a Junior in high school which means it's an important year for her to be focused on her classes and how she is doing in them. But, Generic_Name has just gone through a break-up with her boyfriend and had issues with some of her friends. It's now all that can think about and her mind starts to drift when ever she is in class which is affecting her grades. Students in school deal with drama on a day-to-day basis, and it can affect them to the point that they aren't focused on their classes at all. The only thing they think and talk about is whatever drama is going on in their social life. When they are being taught at home, they do not have to worry about whatever someone else is doing because they are in their own home one on one with a teacher which will allow them to be more focused at the task at hand which is their education. Another way online education can help kids focus is, if they have any issues in dealing with people. Generic_Name has severe social anxiety and suffers from panic attacks and shakiness whenever she as around too many people that she does not know. She can not focus on class because she is to busy dealing with how she feels about the pressure from being in school and being around a lot of people can be a detriment to her education. There are many people who deal with social anxiety or other social disabilities. With online at home classes it can prevent any social issues and help those kids focus. Overall, students being focused is one of the main keys to getting a proper education and any way to improve that and prevent a loss of focus is a good thing."
"Attending classes from home can also allow teachers to be more available to their students and can be there for students based on the students schedule. Generic_Name Plays basketball for a travel league, and they practice every day from 3pm-5pm so as soon as school ends for him, he has to go home get dressed and start making his way to the location of his practice. But if he needed help on a topic that he did not understand in class then he can not necessarily stay after school to ask a teacher a question or get extra help. In an online school system teachers can be available for help at basically anytime if a student needs to have a conference or video call with them. They do what they can be based around a students schedule so that they can better help the student. Another way online school allows teachers to be more available is when, a student may need help while studying late night. Sometimes they run into questions on homework or other practices given to them that they struggle to understand. Teachers can take the time to help them understand so that they can feel confident in their answers. Teachers in online school compared to normal school provide a lot more availability to their students which can be beneficial any many situations students go through outside their education."
"Lastly, online school from home can be beneficial to those that miss school for reasons such as being sick or traveling. Generic_Name had to miss several days of school because he got had a awful fever and while he was gone his teacher had already gone through a whole unit of material that will be difficult to catch up on. If was doing online school he could take the classes while sick because he'll still be at his house. Therefore, he will not have to play catch up on any assignments or notes he missed. He will have them all at the click of a mouse and he's at the same pace as everyone else. Another example is how you can still take all your classes while on a trip. Generic_Name had to go Florida to visit her grandmother for her birthday, but she left on Thursday. While she was away she missed a test and 2 quizzes from her classes that she will have to make up when she gets back to school. This means she will stress out about the material that will be on said tests and quizzes while trying to be on vacation with her family and she may even forget to study for it at all. With the easy accessibility of online classes students can take tests or quizzes on the go while they are traveling. Even if they forget to take it while traveling the can study with the notes and topics they already received from online sessions, so students do not also have to worry about bringing study materials with them. The flexibility with online classes to help kids learn no matter where they are is surely an advantage and a benefit to all students."
"Many people may argue that online school could be too lenient for students and will not emphasize deadlines, can teach kids the same social skills that being in an actual school would, or that online school doesn't place as many responsibilities on students as normal schools. Online classes can make eliminate distractions making it easier to focus, give students more opportunities to get help form teachers, and help out those who may be sick travel when there are important things going on. Over all online classes at home give the same information and teach the same curriculum as normal public schools with giving added benefit of flexibility. This could be the new standard for how classes are taught in the world today."
Being a Seagoing Cowboy does sound like a lot of fun. I think being a Seagoing Cowboy would be fun.
First you are helping others.
"It sounds fun to do, you have something to do, you are being a hero. You get to do a lot of traveling and sightseeing"
You get to see things you have never seen before.
Seagoing gives you the chance to see different when you travel. You kinda become a role model when you are a Seagoing Cowboy. You are looking out for others I think you should be responsible and caring to be a Seagoing Cowboy. It could be a lot of fun and make you happy to protect people. You are making people feel safe.
"In conclusion I think the Seagoing Cowboy program is good for people, and they should join it. It's an important and fun job, sometimes you get hurt, and it can be dangerous but it is awesome. Just be careful with dangers at sea."
"Dear Principal,"
"Some people may not be able to make A's and B's in school, so they try there best that's why I am having a debate about this because it wouldn't be right if the students had to make good grades to play sport because people aren't always really smart, they can't focus during school cause of distractions, people may be having home problems or something like that and that's stops there focus from doing anything productive with their lives."
"Some people aren't as smart as others or can't get the learning which make them not as equally smart as others that throws off grades in school so I don't think it would be equally fair if you couldn't play sports with a ""C ""average then there probably wouldn't be enough players to play any of these sports at these school related activities as some schools get to play with ""D"" average students that's not really fair as I think of it all."
"At school, you find all kinds of distractions in your school environment even outside of school like fights and other things that not really cost for during the school hours people need to learn how to control there self, at school with people in the public it is crazy in this world now in days back then it seems that it was probably no burglary or nothing like that. But now it is crazy in the streets of certain places."
"House problems can also effect a kids school experience because they are probably stressing out and thinking of what is going on at their house ecspeacillay if they are taking care of someone or something like that which is making them worry a lot at school which another way of distraction to other kids, and it is also taking away of their good grades in order to play those sport at school."
"They might as well go on in head and take sports out of schools if they are going to try and make students make good grade just to play sports not all students can do as I say because making an A or B is hard for some of these students, and it will mess them up if they were hoping to go pro in some type of sport. So I don't really think that is a good idea to make it were you have to have a ""B"" average in order to play some type of sport its crazy I think so anyway."

"Dear TEACHER_NAME,"
"You recently posed a school wide question you asked would it be acceptable to change your policy for sports. My answer is no, currently the policy is if you have a C average as in a 70 or above you can play. You want to change it to a B or higher, as in an 80 or above average in everything. I object to this policy because there are people who can barely make it to a 70 an eighty percent average would kill off virtually the whole team in every single sport. Most people in school have one subject they are just terrible at, why ostracize them and make them feel insolent because they can't live up to your unrealistic standard. I am not saying that they are incapable I'm just saying that it would eliminate many who are struggling to keep their C's from becoming F's and failing. They have enough academic problems without trying to get a B as apposed to a C. Plus they are going to worry about their grade dropping and not focus on the game then we'll have a losing season and if we went by grades then all our good players would get put off the team for being ""below your standards"". By changing that policy you are making them feel insolent and ignorant for not being able to reach your standard them eventually they will just give up and the retention rate would go up and the schools academic credentials would lower to nonexistence. Would you really want that to happen all because you wanted to start a new policy? Please don't change our policy for sports our players understand academics comes first, but that policy would kill them all off and scare away recruits for next year."

"In the article ""Driverless Cars Are Coming,"" the author presents information about driverless cars. The article sheds light on both the good and bad aspects of driverless cars. The article talks about many of the topics that come with the subject of driverless cars. Some topics of driverless cars that made it's into this article includes: safety issues, obstacles that had to be overcome during the creation of driverless cars, and laws that will clear up some of the issues that driveless cars pose. Driverless cars should be the ideal mode of transportation in the near future."
"Sensors have been in use in the automotive industry to add safety to their vehicles, and this technology will help make driverless cars much more safe than human-driven vehicles. When driverless cars can completely be self-driven, they will be using many sensors to be safer than their human-driven counterparts. With completely driverless cars, there will be no more room for human errors; there will be nothing that distracts driverless cars. Google has been making semi-driverless cars which have driven more than half a million miles without a single accident. These cars use a multitude of sensors to estimate the distance of objects near them. Sensors have been in use for over 30 years in the automotive industry to improve safety. One of the most important uses of sensors was with the creation of the antilock brake. These sensors were used to apply brakes on individual wheels and reduce power from the engine, allowing far better response and control than a human driver could manage alone."
"Driverless cars are going to be more eco-friendly than human-driven cars. Sergey Brin, a Google cofounder, believes that with a system of driverless vehicles, there would be 50% decrease in use of fuel. He also said that creating a public transportation system comprised of driverless vehicles would fundamentally change the world. With driverless technology, programs could easily be created to help reduce the use of fossil fuels when possible. Driverless cars in the future could perhaps shut off the engine while waiting at a railroad crossing. This is just one of the many uses that programming could help reduce the use of fossil fuels. Regenerative systems could also be put into use to reduce the use of fuel. Hybrid technology has been put into use by many manufacturers today, and could definitely help driverless cars become more eco-friendly."
"Driverless cars are the future of transportation as we know it. There are many positive aspects that will create a much greater society than what we have today. With its safety features, vehicular accidents will become a thing of the past. With the fuel-saving ideas that are up-and-coming for driverless cars, the impact that we have made on our environment will hopefully be reduced. Driverless cars are going to be the new kings of the road."
A reason to join the sea going program is become it took two weeks to cross the
"Atlantic Ocean from the eastern coats of the United States and a month to he to China. Caring for animals during the crossing kept Luke busy. They had to be fed and water two or three times a day. Bales of hay and bags of oats had to BR pulled up from the lower hold of the ship. Stalls had to be canceled. Luke also found time to have fun on board, especially on return trips after the animals had been unloaded. The cowboys played baseball and volleyball games in the empty holds where animals had been housed. Table-tennis tournaments, fencing boxing, reading whittling, and games also helped pass the time. But being a seagoing cowboy was much more than an adventure for Luke bomber. It open up the world to him. Im grateful for the opportunity he says. It made me more aware of people of other countries and their needs. And the aware ness stayed with him leading his family to host a number of international students and exchange visitors for many years. It whas1945,world war 11 was over in group, and many countries were left in ruins. To help these countries recover there food supplies, animals and more,44 fashions joined together to form UNRWA(the united nations relief and rehabilitations administrations). UNRWA hired sea going cowboys to take care of the horses, young cows and mule that were shipped overseas. Luke and don signed up."
The anachronism that is the electoral college is a system that unfairly represents voters and can possibly lead to catastrophe. The much simpler solution would be election by popular vote where every voter in every state matters rather than the system of the electoral college that discounts many voters opinions. The arguments against popular vote are either illogical or inconsequential and we as a nation should pay no heed.
"The biggest and most obvious problem with our current electoral college system is that it unfairly represents voters in the states. An example of this unfairness towards voters propagated by the system is expressed in ""In Defense of the Electoral College: Five reasons to keep our despised method of choosing the President"" by Richard A. Poster where it is stated that in the 2012 election between Romney and Obama Florida gave all of its electoral votes towards Obama when he only won 61.7 percent of the vote. This method completely excludes the opinion of the minority, that 48.3 percent of people in Florida who didn't vote for Obama got their say taken away, their opinion no longer mattered to the election because all the electors were given to Obama by a small majority. A second unfairness to the voters is the attention taken away from any voter not in a swing state. In the article written by Bradford Plume named ""The Indefensible Electoral College: Why even the best-laid defenses of the system are wrong"" it is said that in the 2000 election that seventeen states got no attention from the candidates whatsoever. This system gives undeserved attention to a few swing states which will decide the election because of our outdated system of the electoral college. If popular vote was instituted the attention given to voters of all states would be equal as every vote from every state matters."
"A problem with the electoral college that could possibly outshine the unfairness of it would be the potential for catastrophe that it brings. As is stated in ""The Indefensible Electoral College: Why even the best-laid defenses of the system are wrong"" by Bradford Plume the electors presented by the states according to popular vote are not even obliged to vote for the candidate they said they would. Even though this may be a rare occur ace a single elector betraying his party could cause misrepresentation of millions of Americans. Another possible disaster would be a tie vote in the electoral college. This situation, as explained in the same article, would cause a vastly unfair election incomparable even to the unfairness of the normal system. This horrible system consists of each state getting one vote for the president which when you consider that some states have many times the population of others means that millions upon millions of people could have the same say a couple of hundred thousands, an injustice unthinkable in our society and one that could be stopped by instituting a popular vote system."
"The arguments against popular vote presented in ""In Defense of the Electoral College: Five reasons to keep our despised method of choosing the President"" by Richard A. Poster are unrealistic, unsupported, or insignificant. The argument presented as ""Certainty of Outcome"" says that a dispute over popular vote would be much more common but provides no evidence to support the claim, invalidating it. The article's second argument states that candidates would have more incentive to stay in their region if popular vote were implemented but this entire argument relies on the fact that there are not enough electors in any one region in order to elect a president. Although this is true it doesn't matter because the same is true of population, no one region has an overwhelming population advantage over others and population is what matters in popular vote. The third argument is the most illogical stating that the electoral college's tendency of causing only swing states to matter is actually a good thing because it increases the education of the populations of those states by the increased attention by the candidate, therefore the educated would decide the vote, making it more accurate. This is a parochial and shortsighted viewpoint, not considering the fact that the system of popular vote would make candidates pay attention to all populations, making all voters more educated rather than having some elite educated aristocracy in the swing states. The articles fourth argument is possibly even more deluded than the third, stating that large states get more attention because of the electoral college which balances out the fact that states have hugely varying populations, but the exact same thing would happen in popular vote because some states have larger populations and candidates need larger populations for election in popular vote. The electoral college in this instance changes nothing meaning that the argument leads nowhere. The only argument presented in ""In Defense of the Electoral College: Five reasons to keep our despised method of choosing the President"" by Richard A. Poster that has any merit is the fifth which shows that popular vote could lead to possibly complicated run-off elections. Although that is a disadvantage of popular vote I believe that the vast unfairness and averting disaster is worth the cost of slightly complex run-off elections."
"To support the electoral college one must rely on unrealistic or insignificant evidence. This ""evidence"" can be easily refuted and outweighed by strong evidence from the opposing side. To support the electoral college you are supporting unfairness and catastrophe and to any reasonable person that is not a very intelligent idea, making the need for popular vote irrefutable.  "
Do students have lees benefit if they attend school?
"As we can see teenagers have many options some of them to attend class every day, but some schools let teenager choose if they want to stay in home while they are having class online or video conferencing with a teacher, What benefits teenagers have if they stayed in home?"
"Those students who attend school they have wake up early, and they don't have to miss school, or they are going to miss a lot of information from days that they are absent some of them dropout from school early because they feel pressure we all these things, and they don't have the opportunities to graduate, Also another thing the school is too far from their home, and they not want to walk or waiting in the bus stop cause sometimes the buses came late, and they think that time is wasting, or they got a problem in school, and they don't want to come but still graduate to have a better future. Students have many reasons why they always choose to take classes in online."
"Most of the parents thinks that is better idea that their children takes the classes from home because they feel is more safe for them and they can be out trouble and be caution at whatever situation in the school can happen, they can graduate more easily and fast. Parents always look for the good of their children they always think what would to happen to them if they are not inside the house who can hurt them in school, parents thinks is more easily for them."
"Teachers said that those teenagers who take classes in online they can get more lazy, and maybe they don't know what they're doing because students always need an adult to help them to understands and explain the topics or problems that they have to solve, Also they think if students attend school they develop much better and are more prepare and discover more than the things that they already know."
"Most of the people agree that students have the same benefits if they take the online class because is the things that school teach to an every single students, Also we have people who disagree for the reason that they have to pay for those classes and think they are wasting money for no reason because they have public school that can teach them and not paying anything, so they can graduate and can go to college or the university."
Every single person has a different opinion about taking class from home and their benefits is we looking we are going to know that is the same thing if we pay attention and be careful what we are doing we can reach the goal that we want and make that same thing that we do in school just little different but always is going to be the same benefits. 
Phones & Driving
"Drivers shouldn't be able to use cell phones during driving. They shouldn't be able to because they can cause an accident and harm people, and cause addiction. Using your phone during driving can hurt many people and cause people to get addicted and not pay attention to the road."
"If drivers could use their phones while driving, they can harm people and cause accidents. If they're on their phone they would most likely not pay attention to the road. They can hurt kids and cause road problems. They could even mess up their jobs focusing on their phone and not the objective. Devices can become over powering."
"If drivers could use their phones, it could become addicting and cause problems. They can get addicted to their phone and not pay attention. Devices get addicting and can do too much and can decrease focus. They can be going through a problem and not focus on their man goal."
"Drivers shouldn't be able to use cell phones during driving. They can cause accidents and harm people, and it can become addicting.  "
"The face wasn't designed by aliens. There isn't any proof that alien seven exist. The face is an illusion, you have to catch it at the right angle because if you catch it at another angle you ONT be able to see it. You can see that aliens didn't make it because when they took the picture in 1998 you couldn't really see the face, but in 2001 you could see it 3 times better than the first one. When taking pictures you always have to get the right angle because either something gets left out or something doesn't shows up. If there were any aliens we would have seen them due to the fact that we have spacecrafts taking pictures of it, and we have been on the planet ourselves. If aliens did make it why are we just noticing it why didn't we notice it the other times. Or better than that why haven't we have seen any aliens working on it. If aliens did do it why is that the only thing they made why haven't they made other things why just a face? We all know that aliens doesn't exist so stop saying that until we have evidence that aliens exist."
"In the article, ""A Cowboy Who Rode the Waves."" A boy named Luke Merger went on an ""adventure"" as a Seagoing Cowboy. There are positive and negative things about the ""adventure."" But, I still think people should try out the Seagoing Cowboy programs, because you can see many wonderful views and ECTS."
"One reason people should try out the Seagoing Cowboys program is, you can visit many places that you haven't been before like, China, Europe, and ECTS. Imagine your living in U.S.A. right now, and you dream is to go to Europe. Your dream can come true from trying the Seagoing Cowboy programs! Also, places like Europe and China have their own cultures, which are extremely different from U.S.A.'s culture. According to paragraph 5, it said: ""Besides helping people, I had the side benefit of seeing Europe and China."" So, not only you can visit wonderful places, you can also help people at the same time!"
"Another reason is, you can play games like baseball, volleyball, table tennis, fencing, boxing, and ECTS. Playing sports is one of the most popular things to do in the world. When people have fun doing things, it feels like time pass away extremely fast. The adventure may take weeks or even months, but with fun things like these sports, it'll feel short."
"Like I said in the first paragraph, you can see many wonderful views. This reasons kind of connect to the visiting places that you've never been before, because when you go to a new place, there will be new things you'll see and learn about. Like I said before, most places have different culture. You can find new things or learn something. Some places have different languages to other countries/states. So, maybe you'll learn new languages, and can communicate with people."
"These are some reasons why people should participate in the Seagoing Cowboys program. It might take a long time to travel, but it'll be fun! There might be chances the participators will get hurt, but what is life without a few accidents?"
"Like Merger had participated in this program many times, but he still thinks it's wonderful. According to paragraph 9, Luke said: ""I'm grateful for the opportunity,"" he says. ""It made me more aware of people of other countries and their needs."" That represents he thinks this program is magnificent and fun!"
"Is studying Venus a worthy pursuit ? Venus is a worthy studying pursuit because it has many challenges, but it may have been earth like. In the beginning it talks about the plant being hard to examine up close and Venus having the the hottest surface. The middle talks about Venus once being an Earth like planet and the idea from NASA and machines that will let scientists float above the Venus landscape. The end talks about silicone carbide being tested over Venus's surface."
"Venus is a challenging place to examine because it is really close to the sun which makes it hard to examine. According to paragraph 1 it says"" While Venus is simple to see from the distant but safe vantage point of Earth, it has proved a very challenging place to examine more closely."" Venus is a hard planet to examine because of how close it is to the sun. None of the spacecraft's have survived the landing to Venus, so no spaceships have gone to Venus since. According to paragraph 2 it says"" Maybe this issue explains why not a single spaceship has touched down on Venus in more than three decades. Numerous factors contribute to Venus's reputation as a challenging planet for humans to study, despite its proximity to us."" A spaceship has not gone down on Venus because of the fails with the space craft's."
"Venus is way hotter than the temperatures is 90 times greater than what we experience on Earth. According to paragraph 3 it says ""Venus has the hottest surface temperature of any planet in our solar system, even though Mercury is closer to the sun."" Even though Mercury is closer to the sun Venus is so hot because of all the erupting volcanoes, earth strikes, and lightning strikes that may land on Venus's surface. Astronomers believe that Venus was once similar to Earth because of its features. Paragraph 4 says ""today Venus still has some features that are analogous to those on Earth. The planet has a surface of rocky sediment and includes familiar features such as valley's mountains, and craters."" The Astronomers think since Venus looks similar to Earth because of the rocky, mountains, and valley's type of features."
Some people may think studying Venus isn't a worthy pursuit because of how dangerous it could be for astronomers to examine it. People also may think coming up with devices to make scientists float over the surface is putting them in a position of getting hurt due to all the fails that have happened.
"In conclusion studying Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers because it will make people more curious about the planet, and it will also allow scientists to learn more about the planet and get a better insight up close of the planet rather than far away. With their examination the electronics they make will help them figure out howitzer planet was before."
"Good morning, my name is PROPER_NAME and I would like to talk to you about changing the election to an election by popular vote. The candidate with the most votes of the people should get in. Also, the electors can vote for people other than the people their state chose, and faithless electors are a problem."
"In Richard A. Poster's article, he brought up that in the 2000 election, Al Gore had more popular votes than George Bush, but Bush got more electoral votes, and won the presidency. The election is an election by popular vote, but if the popular vote doesn't get elected, then it isn't an election at all."
"The electors of one state are chosen to pick one candidate and give them their states votes. However, sometimes an elector will get a different idea, and their vote will go to someone else. When that happens, their vote is going against the state citizens decision, so we need a better way of voting."
"The electoral college requires that a candidate list all regions, but not all states. A presidential candidate will skip all the states he knows that are with him, and he will also skip the ones he knows he can't win. A candidate should list all states, so that the voters know what they are voting for, and the electors know that they made the right choice."
"The country would be better off with an election by popular vote, because the votes might get twisted around if there isn't one. The candidate might not even list the states he is hoping for a vote from, so we need to change the system."
"The advantages of limiting car usages is a suggestion idea about car-free cities. Vauban, completed in 2006, is an example of growing trend in Europe, the United States and elsewhere to separate suburban life from auto use, as a component of movement called ""smart planning.'' The reason why they are trying to expand this plan is because the use of car in the cities is growing every day like five times more than the usual. Cities are full of car and you don't have to read these to see that. I know that This is a period of time in which technology is what take the first place in are life, and am I talking about this new model of car. In one part of the view we can see that this care are very attractive and they don't cause any risk to society. But in the other side I would like to show you what specialist people think the cities full of cars. Experts say, is a huge impediment to current efforts to drastically reduce greenhouse gas emission from tailpipes. Passenger cars are responsible for 12 percent of greenhouse gas emission in Europe and up to 50 percent in some car-intensive areas in the United States."
"Let see these in other point of view. Think about your son or your little brother or sister or just link about any little baby that is born in those cities full of cars. The greenhouse gas emission is reduced by 50 percent so the other 50 percent that those kids are breathing is just toxic air. Paths why the hospitals are full of people whit pulmonary cancers and asthma. While there have been efforts in the past two decades to make cities denser, and better for walking, planners are now taking the concept to the suburbs. But its basic precepts are being adopted around the work in attempts to make suburbs more compact and more accessible to public transportation, with less pace for parking. In this new approach, stores are placed a walk away, on a main street, rather than in malls along some distant highway."
"Something that also affect the society is the obesity. People depend a lot on their cars and forgot about to walk. It is a simple example, but it had caused a lot of death and heart ATTAC in the past two decades. ''All of our development since World War II has been centered on car, and that will have to change,'' said David Goldberg. In the United States, the Environmental Protection Agency is promoting ''car reduced'' communities, and legislators are starting to act."
"It was just an informative essay to let the people know about the advantages of limiting car usages. I hope this essay help you to understand and realized about all risk that cars can cause including cars accident. The limit car usage will help everybody starting with those who accept the Environmental Protection Agency promotion ''car reduced''. You can be part of taking care about the environment, and remember ''How much you drive is as important as whether you have a hybrid. (David Goldberg) "
"The idea of planning for a career is to per par yourself and other for the future, career planning is to per par yourself and other for a college that is specific to the career of what you're looking for specific, and help plans for the career job that you or others had work for in the past."
"Students that enter high school should start looking for the career, became it keeps the student commit to the career, and keeps the students focus toward their future careers. If a student start reaching for his or her career can focus more on their career to find the specific college and the job that they study for their career. ""I want to be a computer engineer for my career""."
"Students that start to look for their specific career can plan airily for their future career, student that are working on their careers can work on looking for the specific college that the student that he or she is looking for their career that they plan for. ""The plans I did for my career planning was to take the class that are specific to the career I'm planning for""."
"Students that study for their specific careers for the future, have a higher chance to go to their specific career college, their career job, student that worked for their career have been studying the specific career topic that they have been working for, when they graduate high school they have a higher chance to get except to their career college, and their career job. ""My chances on getting to the college I worked for is a high chance to get except, and I would not have no problem facing college and, my career planning to be a Computer Engineer""."
"Dear Principle,"
"I want to bring your attention to making students do community service. Community service will teach the students how to be responsible, because they will have to be responsible for doing their community service, it will keep them out of trouble, because they have something else to do besides go to friends houses, and party, and they have something them, and their family can be proud of because they made their own decision to help the community."
"Certainly,"
"If you decide to make the students do community service, they will become more responsible. For example, the students will have to be on time to their community service job and that will help them to be on time to other things in life. They will also have to be responsible and make sure they help the community, and not forget to do their job, which is like a normal kid doing homework in school. The student has to do their homework, and they can not forget. I think that community service will help them to also be more independent, because they have to do their own duty of something like picking up trash on school property, and they will not be able to have help because it is their own job. At home, I am responsible for taking out the trash. That is my responsibility, even though it is the family trash. I take out the trash whenever it needs to be taken out, and I do not even get paid, just like a community service job. I do not always want to take out the trash but with community service, it shows me how if I am responsible I am not only helping myself, but the environment, and the people around me."
"Community service will also keep children out of trouble. Some students these days go to party's, and get grounded for several reasons. However, with community service the students will have something to do on their spare time which will lead to not getting in trouble, or being somewhere there not supposed to be. The students will have to be done the community service, but instead of being somewhere their parents can not contact them, they will be building a garden for a school, or helping little kids learn to read, Doesn't that sound better to you? If the students are feeling stressed out they know that they can attend to their community service job instead of doing something bad just to get the stress away. Of course the students could do a community service job with their friends, but the point is that they will be safe and doing something good for the community."
"Have you ever wanted to be the only subject at the diner table? The one your parents want to brag about to their friends? Well, I know I do. If you make the students do community service, their family would be so proud of them for stepping up and helping out. Maybe some kids do not do sports, so their parents do not have something to cheer at every weekend, but If a student came home to their family telling them how good they felt about doing community service that weekend, then the parents have something very special to cheer for. Parents of students want their children to do good in school, and if you consider making community service part of your school, then I am sure that you will be getting calls from parents saying thank-you for making my children do community service I am so proud, and it has helped them so much. I know that if I helped out the community not only my parents would be proud, but I would be more than proud of myself."
"Keep in mind that Some of my friends have already started doing community service on their own, like tutoring elementary school children, and picking up liter on the streets, they told me that it has helped them so much, a ND I would like to be LI Therefore, if you could get everyone in the school to do that then Don't forget it would make everyone have so much more responsibility, as well as they would stay out of trouble, and their family and them would be so proud."
"I think that it will change student is the most spectacular way, and I hope that you agree as well."
"Thank you,"
STUDENT_NAME 
"The school policy that states students should have a B grade average in my opinion is a little unreasonable. The reason I say this is that even though grades are important it really shouldn't affect your ability to play sports. Many schools allow you to have a C average which is usually easier for students to achieve. The thing is that even though academics are a huge part of your school life, what does it really have to do with sports and other activities?"
Now I do understand that if someone is failing all there classes they do need to be talked to and possibly take away the privilege of playing sports. This should be used only if the students grades are below passing. Even-though there a several people who can maintain above class average scores and enjoy sports and other school related activities doesn't mean everyone else does too. You may have a perfect basket ball player that is bad with English this shouldn't mean he can't play basketball anymore. To me it's a little unfair.
Academics are certainly an important part of our school life but even though some of us are better at it than others doesn't mean you need to take away the privileges of their school related activities.
"I do see that you are a very important person being you are the principal of our fine school, so I do hope that you understand where I'm coming from when I tell you that to some of us our activities weather during or after school are important to us and even though we may be not good grades all the time shouldn't mean that we can no longer participate in the activity of our choosing. Thank you for your time in reading this and I do wish we can peacefully figure something out between raising the grade you must have for being a part of sports or any other school activity."
"""All of our development since World War II has been centered on a car, and that will have to change,"" said David Goldberg, an official of Transportation for America. To some or most a stamens like this may seem outlandish or absurd. We use cars for daily life, to make it through this world, whether its to work, school, the store, it seems almost impossible to live without one. Vauban, Germany is an upscale community of suburban pioneers who have simply given up their vehicles. As many as 70 percent of Vauban's families do not own cars. Hadron Walter, a resident and mother of two, says she is ""much happier this way"". So what it is that has caused many communities like Vauban to take the advantage of living without a car? Green House gases better known as smog, that is polluting our air that we breathe."
"In some places like the beloved Paris, home of the Eiffel Tower, smog has gotten out of hand. Paris has even enforced a partial driving ban to clear the air of the global city. After 4,000 drivers were fined and twenty-seven had their cars impounded for their claimed reaction to the fine, the congestion was finally down 60 percent. Beijing, China, known for being the most polluted cities in the world the smog rivals. You might even see people wearing masks in Beijing for their own health and safety."
"Bogotá, Colombia has caught on and spread this idea to other countries as well. For the third straight year cars have been banned with only buses and taxis allowed for a Day Without Cars. Not even rain or shine stopped Colombians from traveling accordingly. Instead of being pessimistic about traveling alternatively most Colombian see it as a good opportunity to take away stress and lower smog. So, imagine a day without cars in the bustling city of our own, maybe like Detroit. Well it seems that President Obama is catching on."
"Recent studies suggest a drop in Americans getting licenses', buying cars, and driving all together as years pass. The number of miles driven in the United States peaked in 2005 and is dropping from there steadily. Could it be that Americans love for cars is simply not what it used to be? Or is it that more alternate and practical ways of travel are now being provided and accepted widely? Either way if our country keeps up the good work sociologist believe it will have ""beneficial implications for carbon emissions and the environment"". Meaning we are one step closer to riding our home planet of dirty air.  "
Electoral College
 Even the best-laid defenses are wrong
"Dear, State Senator"
"The Electoral college process as you know, consist of selection of the electors, the meeting of the electors where they vote for President and Vice President, ant the counting of the electoral votes by Congress (Source 1). Under the electoral college system voters don't vote for president, they vote for a slate of electors that in turn elect for president. Some may think ""What the problem with that it seems like a simple process"" but that's not how it works. Imagine the small states, no candidate is going to spend time in a state where they have no chance of winning making it unfair to voters. There's is also the chance of many segregationists where they don't even take into consideration on who their voting for only basing it on race and or ethnicity. Electoral college is a ""Disaster Factor""(Source 2). Many things can happen in the mist of this selection where the results can end up in a tie which would cause worries. Electoral college is irrational, unfair, and outdated and should not be as a system anymore."
"This ""system"" is unfair to many places across the United States. No candidate would bother going to spend time in a state where they have no chance of winning making it unfair to voters. During the 200 campaign, seventeen states didn't see the candidates at all, including Rhode Island and South Carolina, and voters 25 of the the largest media markets didn't get to see the candidates at all including Rhode Island and South Carolina, and voters in 25ofthe largest media markets didn't get to see a single campaign ad (Source 2). Seventeen states didn't even see candidates making it a harder decision for those states causing some people to not even bother voting. Some may think ""It isn't the candidates faulty that those people didn't vote"" but yes it is the statement is also on opinion and not facts so it's not look into carefully."
There you go it's finally the day to find out the winner and then out of know where you don't find out you know why because of a worry that is a tie. When there is a tie it completely 
"I'm a scientist at NASA and I know that the face is just a natural landform. I have plenty of reasons why that is, and why it wouldn't be an alien. Yes, the face on Mars has become a pop icon, but that doesn't mean people could just assume it's an alien. NASA has plenty information and data for why it's just a natural landform. I'll explain my thinking as me being a scientist at NASA."
"My first reason is that NASA unveiled the image for all to see. The picture noted a huge rock formation which seemed to be a human head that had eyes, nose, and mouth. You just have to think about it, those characteristics are obvious. I mean yes, it was found in Mars, but that doesn't mean it couldn't have been a human. People just have to think more into the possible and not the impossible, because everything is possible."
"My second reason is that they photographed the face. Other scientists at NASA saw that it clearly looked like a human head. My third reason is that they even snapped a picture ten times sharper than the original Viking photos! When the image first appeared on a JPL website, it clearly revealed a natural landform. There was no alien monument after all."
"This is why I, as a scientist at NASA think it's a natural landform and not an alien. These three reasons I have should make people think about it again and decide it's officially a human head. Those who believe it's an alien, should believe more in miracles. Anything could happen in Mars or any other place around the planet. This is only my opinion, but it sure makes me feel like I'm right about my thinking."
"Have you ever felt like you need to spend time with your pets? Do you ever feel like you need to make a difference in the world, for animals and humans alike? Well then join the ""Seagoing Cowboys"" of the UNRWA (the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration) today! You will get a one in a lifetime chance while spending time overseas, traveling to new countries, and spend all of that time with horses, young cows, and mules. Not only are you going to travel to new places, you will also see many sights you may never see again. After a hard day at sea caring for different animals you can play games, have a variety of different sports tournaments, or just play rounds of games such as basketball or volleyball."
"While most people don't call fun feeding and watering horses, there is much more to being a ""Seagoing Cowboy"" that just that. After your turn to feed or water that animals is over, board games or even just playing with a deck of cards is options. After you get off of the ship there are hundreds of activities and tourists attractions in the different countries such as Greece, China, Crete, and many more places all around the world that you can see and do. In Crete there are ancient Greek castles in ruins, in Greece you can see the Acropolis (which was a very special occasion for me). I even took a gondola ride in Venice, Italy. Doing this job has many benefits other than just helping horses and other animals."
"On top of all of those reasons for being fun, I also had a great time spending time with the animals. Doing this job isn't as simple as it sounds though. I had to know when you need to feed or water the animals (which is two to three times a day) and I also had to make sure they didn't get sick on the voyage. On top of that you also have to carry the hay and oats for 335 different animals onto the ship. But, although it's not easy, it still was a lot of fun for me, and I'm guessing it was also fun for the other people that went on the trip too. I enjoyed this job so much, I did it nine times because it was so much fun. I enjoyed doing it so much I did it the most out of anyone, and I think you will too."
"The final reason I think you will enjoy doing this is because this trip is a one in a lifetime opportunity. Some people have never been on an airplane, some people have never been on a boat, but this is different. This is more than just a family vacation. This is an opportunity do something different. This is a chance to go do something most people have never done before. While you may have plans to go to a different state, or a different country, how many people have ever said ""I want to travel across the seas with hundreds of different animals just to ship them to a different country."" This is not something everyone gets to do. Make it something you get to do."
"This is something everyone should want to do, and I just gave you three reasons why you should do it. This is a one time chance to do something most people have never done. Join the ""Seagoing Cowboys"" today for the best vacation a person can have."
"Dear senators it possible for you to change the electoral college to election by popular vote for the President of the United States because it's better."" Acording to source one, the electoral college consists of 538 electors""."" A majority of 270 electoral votes is required to elect the president"". That's a lot of votes that electoral college needs."
"In source two it says ""over 60 percent of voters would prefer a direct election to the kind we have now"". More people prefer the direct vote because under the electoral college system voters vote for a slate of electors, who in turn elect the president. Acording to the article in reason one."" In 2012 Obama received 61.7 present of the electoral vote compared to 51.3 percent of popular votes for him and Romney. Because almost all states award electoral college votes on a winner- takes-all basis""."
"For example in reason five ""Nixon in 1968 and Clinton in 1992 both had only a 43 percent plurality of the popular votes, while winning a majority in the electoral college(301 and 370 electoral votes, respectively).a lot of people say that electoral college method of selecting the president may turn off potential voters for a confident. People that are in presidential elections are people who want to express a political preference rather than people who think that a single vote may decide an election.  "
"The thought of taking classes from home doesn't sound as pleasing one would think, here's why. Taking classes from home can cause more problems than solutions. Learning from home puts more stress on the students by relying on them to stay focused with no help. In my opinion, I believe students can't benefit as much from taking classes from home due to lack of focus, little peer help, and barely any teacher overview."
"People tend to get sidetracked easily when taking classes from their home. There are more variables at home that cause distractions to the students. For example, a student is trying to understand the lesson, but his little sibling won't stop bothering him causing him to be off-topic. Furthermore, students are more likely to be focused in class due to being in a true learning environment rather than being in the comfort of their home. Being in class allows the students to put their thoughts solely on their work. These positives of being in class are gone when students decide to learn from home."
"Peer help is limited when learning from home. In some cases, listening to a peer has proved to be more helpful than constantly listening to a lecture from the teacher. The sound of a new voice explaining the matter can really be beneficial. At home, it's just the teacher in the video explaining the lesson and the student trying its best to understand. If it comes to a student being completely lost, a classmate is usually there to get them on back on track. Also, group work with peers is another way that benefits learning; however, that ability is hindered when learning at home due to the work being placed on just one student."
"Teacher overview is missed when learning at home. The presence of the teacher teaching connects to the students more instead of hearing or seeing a lecture online. Moreover, being face to face with a teacher trying to teach a student is more beneficiary than just looking online. When the teacher asks students if they need any help, it causes the students to be more comfortable, which leads to better learning. Also, if a student starts developing that connection with a teacher, the fear of letting that teacher down can prevent grades from slipping."
"The negatives of taking a class from home outweighs any positives. There are certain elements that are missing when learning from home, but are present from working in school. Plus, there are variables that can cause more distractions at home than at school. In my belief, online schooling is not as much of a benefit."
"Do you think that all students must participate in at least one extracurricular activity in school? I disagree with this decision because, some students don't have a ride to pick them up after school, they high have to babysitter there little brothers and sisters, also they might have some family issues going on. Some students might not want to join any school activity not even if you try to convinced then to."
"Some students Donald´t have a ride to pick them up if they participate in a school activity. They couldn´t get picked up because, either their parents are at work or doing something very important. So you have to call one of your family members and hope one of them could pick you up. I had to call one of my family members to pick me up because, my mom and dad couldn´t pick me up, I was so scared that no one was going to pick me up, but thank god that my aunt came a picked me up. Sometimes you might have to ask one of your friends parents or their older sibling that can drive to take you home."
"Some students have little brothers and sisters they have to look after because, their parents have to go to work or their parents have to go do something real quick. For example your parents could go grocery shopping, go on a date and more. Your parents might not want to hire a babysitter to watch your little siblings because, they not trust the person with their kids, so they tell you to watch them. Most likely your parents have to work all week so your mom, or dad just ask you to watch your younger siblings."
"Some people have family issues that they have to deal with. For example if one of the family issues was, my parents are always are arguing every day, and you have little siblings, wouldn´t you go home and protect them and calm them down if they are scared? I would go home and do that if I had young siblings. Some students could have worker issues then that because, their parents could be getting a divorce, one of their parents could be getting abuse or someone could have died in their family and more."
"So that is most of my resends that I disagree about all students must participate in at least one extracurricular activity in school. Student have thing going on in their lives that they Canada´t participate in any school activities. Some students Donald´t even want to try school activities if you try to convince them GTO do so. Trust me I tired to convince people to do school activity like play sports or even join the club, they just won't even try it. Anyway most people Donald´t have a ride to pick them up, they might have to babysitter their sibling, or they just have some family issues going on; Also there are even more reasons than mine to prove that all students Montana´t have to participate in at least one extracurricular activity in school."
"""Hello Mrs. Generic_Name, I am planning on starting a lemonade stand business."" Generic_Name said, ""Every Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays. What do you think of my new idea?"" ""Well, I don't know. I know a friend who started a clothing company last year, and went out of business because now bought her products! The only customer she had was me."" Mrs. Generic_Name said. ""That's unfortunate, well thank you for answering my question."" Generic_Name said. ""No problem my dear."" Mrs. Generic_Name said. ""Hey Generic_Name!"" Generic_Name said, ""How is your cell-phone business going?"" Generic_Name asked, ""It's going well, I sold twenty-five cell-phones in one day."" Generic_Name answered. ""Wow that's incredible!"" Generic_Name remarked. ""Why do you ask?"" Generic_Name asked suspiciously, ""Well I was thinking of starting a lemonade stand business, and I need your opinion."" Generic_Name said. ""Okay, I would recommend you to start your business because it's fun, and you see satisfied customers."" answered Generic_Name. ""Thanks!"" Generic_Name said. It is important to ask people for their opinions because they help you to make the best choice, give advice, and share experience, so you know what to expect when you make the decision."
"First, we should ask for advice because they tell us the best choice. Whether it is from experience or not, they can tell us their opinions and tell us what to do and what not to do. Maybe their business has gone out of business because they couldn't sell enough products, or they didn't do something specific. For example, when Mrs. Generic_Name's friend started her clothing business, she didn't get any sales because her clothing prices were probably too high. No one would buy clothes that are more expensive. They wouldn't need to buy clothes that are way too expensive."
"Secondly, you should listen to them when they tell you advise. Take the advice they give you and use it. The advice could help you with anything. You can use advice every day. For example, my dad told me advise to do my homework and not procrastinate because later on, the homework will just pile on, and I'll never be able to finish it even if I take eight hours during the day, I'll never finish because of the amount of homework I have to do is so much."
"Lastly, when people share their business experiences when they started their own businesses, it's important to listen because it can help you when you end up in a situation that happens frequently like, when you don't sell enough of something or make enough money that you need, and you might have to go out of business. Other entrepreneurs can help you when that situation occurs."
"""Hello, you are my first customer."" That's lovely said Generic_Name's first customer. ""Would you like strawberry lemonade or regular lemonade?"" Generic_Name asked. ""I would like regular lemonade please."" Answered her customer, ""Okay that would be thirty cents."" Generic_Name said. ""Oh wow that's a reasonable price for a cup of lemonade!"" Her customer said as she was taking a sip of her drink. ""It's delicious!"" ""Thank you, come back next time!"" Generic_Name said. This is why it is important to ask people for their opinions because they help you to make the best choice, give advice, and share experience, so you know what to expect when you make the decision."
Limiting Car Usage
"Limiting car usage is a very good idea. It can save a lot of money, keep pollution from happening, and keep people safe. If more people tend to save money because of cars, then they can buy more stuff. If more people save the environment people can have fresh air to breath in. Multiple resources have been found to support the idea that limiting car use can save a lot of money and make the environment safer."
"For example, ""In German Suburb, Life Goes On Without Cars"" by Elisabeth Rosenthal, it states that ""As a result of buying a parking space for $40,000, 70 percent of Vauban's families do not own cars, and 57 percent sold a car to move here. When I had a car I was always tense. I'm much happier this way,"" said Hadron Walter."" This quote explains the troubles and tension that one has to deal with when having a car. ""In previous bills, 80 percent of appropriations have by law gone to highways and only 20 percent to other transport."" When Vauban, Germany had cars, their bill went up higher for highways instead of other transports. People should start to use other means of transport instead of cars."
"In ""Paris bans driving due to smog"" by Robert Duffer, Robert helps explain the reason why driving should be banned. ""Paris enforced a partial driving ban to clear the air of the global city."" Paris is very smart to do that, because cars create pollution. The way that they partially banned driving is that ""Motorists with even-numbered license plates were ordered to leave their cars at home or suffer a 22-euro fine ($31). The same would apply to odd-numbered plates the following day."" At least Paris partially protected the environment instead of the whole environment having to be in pollution."
"In ""The End of Car Culture"" by Elisabeth Rosenthal, the author supports the idea of limiting car usage for the concern of safety. Safety is a really important thing in life. Cars can limit the danger of getting in a car accident. ""He proposed partnering with the telecommunications industry to create cities in which pedestrians, bicycle, private cars, commercial and public transportation traffic are woven into a connected network to save time, conserve resources, lower emissions, and improve safety."" If people did not have cars, then nobody would have to worry about accidents and their safety."
"In conclusion, limiting driving and the usage of cars can improve the world. It can make it a safer environment, safe money, and stop pollution. These evidences from the excerpts can prove that limiting car usage is a perfect idea."
"Summer projects can help students continue learning during summer break. However, there is a debate on whether they should be designed by the teachers or the students. I think they should be designed by the teachers for several reasons: teachers' experience will help them create more engaging projects, teachers will know what their students struggled on throughout the year and will be able to address those topics in the project, and teachers will assure that the project is on the student's grade level."
"First, teachers have way more experience creating assignments than students do. This superior knowledge will help them create a project that will go deeper than the surface level, which students might not be able to do if designing their own project. This more in-depth project will be more engaging in the students and should help them learn better over the summer break."
"Second, the teachers have been with the students for at least a year. Throughout the year the teachers have been seeing what topics students are doing well in or what topics they need more help with. If a student is struggling in an area, then the summer project should be about that topic to ensure that the students jumps back into learning prepared. If a student were to design the project them self, they would want to make it about easy topics or topics they are already good at, not the ones they really need help in. Having teachers create the projects will ensure that the most needed topics are covered and will help students get back to learning with less confusion."
"Finally, If a teacher designs the summer project it will definitely be on the student's grade level. While a student might be able to create a project that they would enjoy doing or is engaging to them, they will most likely make it easy for them self which will hinder their learning. A summer project should challenge the student's knowledge on their grade level, and only a teacher can ensure that that happens. An on grade level project will properly challenge the students without being too easy or to hard which studies have shown to be more effective for the students learning."
"Overall, summer project should be constructed by teachers and not students because the teachers can make the projects engaging, specialized, and on grade level. Students will learn better over break, come back to the classroom with less confusion, and will learn more effectively. While it might be fun for the student to design their own project, students should be given the best possible opportunity for learning and only a teacher can guarantee that. That is why teachers should design summer assignments rather that students.  "
I believe they should change the voting to popular votes. In my perspective voters are the most important in the elections. There opinion on the president should be able to count either way. Lots of voters feel left out like there opinion don't count. Sometimes the president elected by the electoral college is not the one every one wanted; he has different points of view in what he wants to do.
The president that the electoral college has elected is not always the one everyone expects to be. Lots of presidents have won by electoral college not by the voters. These presidents that are elected by the electoral college can possibly be the presidents to bring the United States to the ground.
"The voters feel they know what is best for our country. They always elect the person that will bring America to the top. For example Barack Obama he is helping immigrants go back to school be able to get a job and be something in life, like maybe a mechanic, doctor, or even a federal officer. They chance that he has given us lets people know that these are the type of presidents we need."
People feel left out because if the electoral college AR the people that are going to select the president what is the point in voting. Lots of them feel that electoral college is more important than what we the people think. The electoral college doesn't let people feel that the person hat they have selected is the president that will help out the United States Of American to become number one.
"On the other hand people believe that the electoral college is good, and we should keep having it. They believe this because they think that they know what is best for us. Also, that their vote is the best option than ours."
I believe that the president should be able to win by popular vote because we the people shall select the best president. The president that will once again put the U.S. back on top. The president that wins should win by popular vote not by the electoral college.  
"Students may say inactivity is the way to go, However other student say keeping yourself occupied will lead you towards achievement. But staying occupied is the way to go if you want to be successful and achieve things in life. Sitting around and doing nothing won't lead you to anything successful in life."
"If you're at home sitting around having nothing to do will not help you to be successful. If you try to find something productive to do it will help you in the future. To be productive or to do something productive really doesn't have to be school work related it can be anything like having a job, chores or helping around the community."
"Let's say you have homework but you don't feel like doing it, because you're used to not doing anything and or are lazy to do it. Which means you are more likely to procrastinate. On the other hand if you're used to doing your work the same day its assigned and or turn it in on time you are less likely to procrastinate because you are used to staying occupied and doing all your work."
"From my own experience, when I was 14-15 years old i wouldn't do anything at home or at school which caused me to do negative things that didn't lead me to achieve my goals at that moment. Now that I'm 17 years old I keep myself busy by doing school work or working my part-time job, which won't cause a negative effect on me because I'm preparing myself for my future and life goals."
"Overall students think that doing nothing is the way to go, but other students say that keeping themselves occupied leads them to a successful and positive life."
Nowadays I can tell that teenagers that have been getting into legal trouble really don't have anything to do outside of school. While other teenagers actually do outdoor and indoor activity to keep themselves out of trouble.
A Former British Man a Prime Minister Winston Churchill once said that ''
success consists of going from failure to failure wit out loss of enthusiasm
.''
"Is like saying that people are more afraid of success that they are in failure. What Winston is talking about that is okay to lose once in a while as long you have that smile in your face that you already a winner of yourself, like playing a soccer game, but your team loses, but you lose as a team, failing a quiz you just gotta do better in the retake you can't give up on something that is precious to you. People make mistake and people learn from it just try to do better next, so you can succeed on winning. Some people are scared to take the chance to succeed because that taking a risk of failure and people have, but you won't know if you try. Winston Churchill want people to never give up on your dream. If you learn more about the subject you won't got any worried about a thing. Once I was little I have a hard time learning and participating in class that my mother and father didn't know about the time that they constant working to provide us a house, food,and clothes. I have to restart kindergarten because of my failure that I didn't bother asking my mother about was my mom knew about they took me to a doctor to check on me that I have a learning factor my mother was worried that I have to transfer every school that have a program for me then there was one school that help me learn better communicate with teacher answering question when I first started high school I look back when I was little and started to laugh and think I have so many chances to succeed in life that one day I'll go back to the teacher and say thank you for everything, so I have to go through of failing but never lose my hope of becoming a winner."
"Cars, some people think they are the most important things ever made. In some places like Colombia they barely ever use them. Some people in Colombia even say that their everyday life is maybe even easier. People actually do get more easily stressed by just owning a car. With all this evidence given it is clear that limiting cars would be an advantage."
"Cars are in fact a big disadvantage. In source one it even goes into detail about how much money it is too just to be a car-owner. In Freiburg, Vauban's streets there are ""car-free"" car-owners spend $40.00 along with a home to have space for their cars. As results to this 70 percent of people in Vauban are not car-owners and 57 percent sold their cars. In source one it also says that the United States previous bills were 80 percent alone have gone to the highways and another 20 percent to transport. In source two and three Paris and Colombia were having to pay for fines of $25 to $31."
"As another result to all the money people are playing just to be a car-owner people get very stressed over all of this. In source three Colombia banned cars except buses and taxis. After three years of banned cars people hiked, biked, skater, took the bus or took a taxi. With the three years and still in progress people in Colombia soon began to relies that ""it's a good opportunity to take away stress"" said Carlos Arturo Plaza a local business man in Colombia."
"Of course no one could buy any cars or stress over them if we can't breathe. Cars do hurt our environment and green houses. By the gas and pollution we put into the world by just driving our cars around isn't any after as if we got into a car crash. Every time we drive cars or take the bus we just hurt our planet, plants, and people a little more and more. Just by this fact alone people should know that driving cars around everywhere is a giant disadvantage."
It would be an advantage to limit car usage because cars make everyone pay large amounts of money just to be called a car-owner. From spending all this money and being fined over stuff people do believe isn't fair most people in fact do stress themselves out over this which is not healthy for anyone. Another fact about limiting cars is that it would indeed improve our safety not one for us people but for our environment too.
"Careers are a big part of a person's life. People can choose from thousands of careers that interests them. Careers usually tell a person's personality. A lot of people take careers very seriously and want to know more about careers. Students committing to a career at a young age is a good idea because students will know what a career is really like, they will find something fun to do every day, and they won't have to worry about it in their adult lives."
"Students committing to a career at a young age is a good idea because students will know what a career is really like. Some students lack information about becoming a doctor. Students often don't know what it is like to become a doctor, or know the basics. In order for students to obtain information and knowing how to treat a patient, they need to experience it physically. It is a good idea for students to take action in a career because they will get more information about it. In addition to knowing what is like to become a doctor, students can look up a career they want to know more information about. For example, if a student wants to know more information about dentistry, they can easily research what do you need to do to become a dentist. Students should engage in a career early because they can find a lot of resources to get there."
"A second reason students should be in a career early is because they will find something fun to do. Most students don't really do anything after school or in their free time. The students who don't take action in doing anything, will more likely become miserable and bored. For these students the only thing they should do is join in after school program that helps and educates students about careers. Students should be involved in a career at a young age because a lot of students don't know what to do in their free time. Also, students don't really have a hobby they can do. Students sometimes don't really think about having a hobby that can keep them happy. Students can find that hobby by taking part in a career and actually find something that really interests them."
Students need to be in a career at a young age because they will find something that is important to them.
"A final reason students should commit to a career early is because they won't have to worry about it in their adult lives. Most teens don't know what they want to do later on as they become adults. These people usually struggle in finding a job, and also getting that job. If a student spends extra amount of time in school reading and getting information about a career, they won't have that problem later on. In fact, they will easily know what they want to do. Students who get into a career at a young age won't have any problems in finding a job later on. In addition to finding a job, students as they get older won't have any stress on what they want to be. When students graduate high school they are pressured in finding a job, which makes them really stressed. Some students aren't as stressed as others because they already know what interests and them and what they want to be."
"If a student who doesn't know at all what they want to be, they should spend lots of time on researching and attending career based programs to give them an idea or two on what to be. Students should part of a career at a young age because they won't be as stressed."
"Some people firmly believe that students should not commit to a career at an early age because they aren't well-educated about a career. Unfortunately, these students are more likely to have problems later on when finding a job. In order for students to fully know about a job is to take part in a career fair or just overall being in a career, so they can be successful when doing so. Students should commit in a career early because they will be more educated in a career. In addition to, they will find a hobby in their free time. Finally, they won't have any stress or problems later on in finding a job."
"I agree what Emerson is talking about because nobody should ever tell you that you can not be yourself or feel wrong about them self. If you want to be a doctor then go head make your dream come true or if you want to be a nurse then go head do not let anyone stop you because at the end of the day you who wants to make your dream come true and who wants to be a better person in life and who wants to make your family proud of you of, what you have become, what you have been working hard for. If you want to be a nurse then you will need to work really hard and study if you want to get to that level and to that point. If people do not like who you are, and they think bad about you do not let to them bring you down keep doing you prove to them that you do not need them in your life and that you can do better without them"
Because you the one who wants to be a better person in life. If people want to say stuff behind your back gone them because they are the ones who are going to feel bad about them self.
"Timmy thinks the faces on Mars were created by aliens, but I keep telling him its just natural landforms that we made, and it looks like faces. It happens even on Earth, it is common around the American west. In the viking photo they didn't have that well equipment to see what it actually was, so they thought it was created by plans. In 2001, NASA water to show the world and they captioned a note by it saying ""huge rock formation,"" but people just saw a face because of the shadows in it. The authors reasoned it to be a good idea to engage people and give attention to Mars."
"The ""Faces on Mars"" started to become popular, they started to make movies, books, magazines, radio talk shows, and even haunted grocery store checkout lines. In April 1998 they flew over it again, they had better technology, and they didn't see a face all they saw was a natural landform. Then in 2001 they did it again and didn't see anything just the landform, and they had much better technology where you could see a small shack and nothing was there."
These Faces were just landforms that had a shadow that made it look like a face.
"Every planet has weird landforms, and they didn't really have good technology back then. Now they have a lot better technology were they can drive robots on Mars and see all these weird landforms and see if there are aliens."
"For more than a hundred years now, we have been relying on automobiles for many things. Since the beginning, we've seen a tremendous increase due to the more factories built and more company founded to create different versions and models of cars. We use them to go place to place. However, it does have its downfall. The majority of pollution caused by cars driven around the entire planet is caused by the emissions released from the car itself. Obviously that's nowhere near healthy, so why not try limiting the car usage?"
"Many places round the world have already begun trying little projects in order to cut back on smog or pollution. In Vauban, Germany, for example, a tremendous amount of people don't own cars. According to the excerpt from ""In German Suburb, Life Goes On Without Cars"" by Elisabeth Rosenthal, it mentions how 70 percent of Vaughn's families do not own cars and 57 percent sold one to move there. The streets are completely carefree minus the main thoroughfare where the tram to downtown Freiburg runs. All of this turned into a growing trend throughout Europe to separate suburban life from car usage. It's referred to as ""smart planning"". Experts say these changes are a huge impediment to current efforts to drastically reduce greenhouse gas emissions from tailpipe. Another positive effect of this experiment, stores are placed a walkaway, on a main straight, rather than in malls along some distant highway. Think about living in an environment where you can actually breathe in the fresh air and not choke on it thanks to the smell of exhaust fumes coming from all the automobiles contesting the streets and cities you'd like to walk in."
"Another advantage of limiting car usage is reducing stress and tension caused by driving. In Bogotá, Colombia, millions of Colombians either hiked, biked, skated, or took buses to work during their ""carefree day"", according to the excerpt from ""Carefree Day is Spinning into a Big Hit in Bogotá"" by Andrew Silky. The only permitted automobiles are buses and taxis during those days. The goal of the entire event is to ""promote alternative transportation and reduce smog."" Anyone who violated the program would face a 25 fine. ""'It's a good opportunity to take away stress and lower pollution,' said businessman Carlos Arturo Plaza as he rode a two seat bicycle with his wife."" During one of the years, two more cities from the country joined. Due to event, it improved a campaign which began in the mid1990s where there's been a construction of 118 miles of bicycle path which is the most of any Latin American city, according to Mocks who is the city's mayor. Another positive result of this project was the blooming of parks and sport centers throughout the city. Even the uneven, pitted sidewalks have been replaced, rush hour restrictions have dramatically cut the amount of traffic and new restaurants have cropped up. It was as if the entire city itself was renovated thanks to their Carefree Day."
"Considering the fact that transportation is the second-largest source of America's emissions according to the excerpt from ""The End of Car Culture"" also by Elisabeth Rosenthal, it's not a bad idea limiting car usage. At the end of the day, we have more advantages than anything else. Those include reducing the amount of smog and pollution caused by the automobiles' emissions and reducing stress plus the tension while driving. Again, who wouldn't want to be able to walk around town enjoying the outside beautiful environment nature provides us with, without having to hold their breath every time a car or truck passes by with their nasty exhaust fumes? Make the world a better place to live in."
"Their has been quite a lot of recent talk of which the national government should keep the Electoral College, or change to an election by popular vote for the President of the United States. ""The Electoral College process consists of the selection of the electors, the meeting of the electors where they vote for President and Vice president, and the counting of the electoral votes by congress""(Source 1: What is the Electoral College? By the office of the federal register). IT has been established by the founding fathers to make a compromise between popular vote and election vote in congress. Popular representation is a vote for qualified citizens to take an individual vote cast to the state which then is transferred to a representative whole. The are many good effects this popular representation has on the country, but the Senator should keep the Electoral College without a shout of a doubt."
"One of the most important reasons we should keep the electoral college process is that in this process, states pay much more attention to the electors due to having swing states. The people who decide on our president should be most intrigued and the most concerning ones. ""Voters in toss-up states are more likely to pay close attention to the campaign - to really listen to the competing candidates- knowing that the are going to decide the election(in defense of the electoral college: five reasons to keep our despised method of choosing the president, by Richard a. poster, subtitle Swing States)"".  Many voters that are in swing states, which are stated that cast the majority of votes in the system with higher amounts of population, therefore congress representatives."
"Another reason why the gov should keep the electoral college is because it resorts unwanted balance.  ""There is no pressure for run-off elections when no candidate wins a majority of the votes case; that pressure which would greatly complicate the presidential election process, is reduced by the Electoral College, which invariably produces a clear winner"" so what this quote from the passage is saying is that no candidate receives a majority if the votes cast, due to each state's fair rep of the population without being overwhelmed by the most populated states such as Florida, California, and Texas. While you may believe that the popular representation vote may be overwhelmingly more accurate to the people wants, you are wrong. The electoral college is a processes in which gives the people want in a state to an elector who then gives you an equal chance ONF voting for what you pleased. He may be the ""biggest"" or ""smallest"" amount of electoral votes, but as a state in a whole you may receive a big surprise that there is no clear winner as each [president may not be just familiar with one region such as the north-east, or the southwest, etc."
"So as you can see, the government should keep an electoral college process instead of the popular representation vote. It would be greatly appreciated to the United States People who may be under informed of how great an opportunity for an idea such as this to some up, or they might be over informed of fallacy information of our election process now. Either way, that should know what a great process this is"
"There are many advantages and disadvantages of limiting car usage according to reading passages about limiting car usage. Many people think that car usage doesn't need to be limited because everyone loves their car, but everyone loves their life also."
"What I mean about everyone loves their life is that people fail to realize that cars are troublemakers, they cause a lot of problems, and that is pollution. Pollution from anything is very harmful especially to the people who don't have transportation, and they have to walk or ride a bicycle to their destination. In many states the usage of cars are banned and that's because their pollution rate is horrific. I mean who wants to live somewhere where you can't even walk your dog because of the pollution from the automobiles?"
"In Paris on Monday motorists with even-numbered license plates were ordered to leave their cars at home or suffer a 22- euro fine ($31). But the same would apply to odd-numbered plates the following day. Furthermore, in Paris almost 4,000 drivers were fined, and Twenty-seven people had their car impounded for their reaction to the fine. Paris has more smog than any other European capital."
"Did you think that Paris was the only country that has banned cars?, Well you thought wrong because Bogotá, Colombia has banned cars for three straight years and only left with buses and taxis permitted for the Day Without Cars in this capital city of 7 million. Bogotá, Colombia goal is to promote alternative transportation and reduce smog violators face $25 fines. In 1990 The Days Without Cars is part of an improvement campaign that began to help decrease the effective amount of smog or pollution. Since the help to decrease the amount of smog parks and sports centers have bloomed throughout the city; uneven, pitted sidewalks have been replaced by broad, smooth sidewalks; rush-hour restrictions have dramatically cut traffic; and they have built new restaurants and upscale shopping districts have cropped up."
"After all I am here to say that many states are banning the usage of cars because they send off large amounts of pollution and pollution is a very harmful debris that can harm many people, and it can cause sickness, and possibility death. If you are living or moving to a different state that bans car usage I strongly encourage you to let your car sit in the garage and look pretty because we are trying to save our people, plants, animals, and most important our communities."
I think getting other people's advises is good idea because it could be helpful to a person in many ways for making life decisions or making financial decisions or living decisions. There are many people who you could like a family member or your friends cause those who are the people are the closets to you.
"When looking for different people's advises, you want them to see your perspective and see which is the best choice you can do or sometimes maybe you want to buy a car. You want to get friends opinion on whether you should buy a car or not cause getting their opinions will help make the best decision. I think it would be better to ask a friend for their opinion when making a financial decision cause maybe you have a friend that already has a car. You could ask that friend what It's like to get car and the steps to it, and they could tell whether it's a good decision or not. Sometimes a friends decision might not be that helpful, so you could ask your family like your parents or siblings."
"Families are better to get an advice because your parents are the people who already went through what you are going through, so they could give you the best advice on how to be better. For example, when making life decision, I think it's best to go to a family member because those are the people who can really help you. Maybe you want to choose a college you want to go to, but you don't where to go, you could ask a sibling our parents where it could be the best place for you to go and tell you how It's like to go to college. You may have an older sibling who went to college and graduated, so you can ask them how It's like to be in college and what are the goods and bad and give you advice on how to get through college without it being hard for you. Some siblings could even recommend you to go to the military or army, anything related to that because there are benefits to that and help you with school. Families are better to get an advice because your parents are the people who already went through what you are going through, so they could give you the best advice on how to be better"
"Sometimes you don't want to ask people for their advice or maybe you want to make the decisions yourself. Additionally, some decisions you make on your own so for example, you don't want to career you want to take for when you go to college. You start stress a lot because you are in your last year of high school and still don't know what you want to do for your future. You ask your friends and family now even though you didn't want to, that how could you figure out what you want to do for your career. They give you the advice to chose what you like to do as a career, and then you start to do research on colleges that could be best for the career you want to take. You finally make your decision on what you want to do as your career and what college you want to go to, to pursue that career. You realize that you can't make a lot of decisions on your own without help from others."
"As the conclusion, we realized that we always should ask the people around for advice and get their perspective to see what they would do if they were you."
Dear Mr. Senator:
Lately there's been a problem regarding electoral colleges. Some people are in favor of them; others not so much. I agree with the latter; electoral colleges are anachronistic and should no longer be used in this day and age.
"In this modern era, people are being more aware or more educated about the goings in government. As a result, it is becoming no longer necessary to have others vote in place of the people's choices. Instead, people should be able to vote directly for their chosen leaders and not have to worry about an elector making a last minute decision to vote for another."
"Those who are in favor of electoral colleges are wrong about keeping them. In only half-way allowing people to vote for president, it could also be viewed that the people were never really given a choice. Their votes are at the mercy of the electors."
"If you are wise Mr. Senator, you'll choose to do away with electoral colleges. By doing so, you give people more choice and control over their decisions. I hope you'll put your foot down on this matter and refuse to have anything to do with electoral colleges because they're not helping the future of our country,"
"Sincerely,"

"The ""technology to read students"" is a great idea because, it could help many students and teachers know when it is time to stop and when it is time to begin. Some students can't focus as long as other students can."
"""Technology to read students"" knows when a student is bored. This is great because, if a student is bored during a lesson then you know the lesson isn't helping them. It will also help teacher out to pick a different assignment or move on to something else. If the assignments are boring it looks bad on students and also the teacher, because nobody is getting work done. So technology that reads students would help out big time."
"If technology knows when you are mad, or frustrated the computer would know that and the computer would alert the teacher then, the teacher would know you were probably frustrated because you were struggling. Say a student was scared or nervous to ask the teacher for help, the teacher would get the alert from the computer saying the student is frustrated."
"Last, technology will tell you if the student is happy. This will help because, if students are happy with an assignment that means they are getting it, and they know what they're doing. The teacher will get an alert saying students are happy then that means they are enjoying the assignment or lesson. If everyone is happy it looks good on students and teachers."
"""Technology reads students"" is a great idea because, it would help so many people out in school. It would lead to better test scores. More money for teachers. If technology could read students, it would be a great source!  "
Dear principal
"I understand what you're wanting to do, Having all the students to get B's to participate in your schools sport program, but what you don't understand is that not everybody is capable of getting B's in your school. Your students could try the hardest they ever tried but still not achieve what your goal is. Sometimes when students get a B or a C there parents and guardians congratulate them, and they say to themselves that they did good. And some students rely on sports to help them with any issues that there facing in their personal lives. There are many other reasons why there should not be a change made, So many I can't even list them all. But if you change it to having B's, most of your students wouldn't get to participate in any sports whatsoever. They may feel bad because they couldn't achieve the grades that you recommended they should and that could result in students becoming depressed. What I think you should to is had your whole school take a test on what they know all around and just base it on that. It all depends on what they know and what they want to know. Some students just choose not to pay attention and not do there work, and those students don't deserve to be in sports. The students who try there best should be the ones that can participate in this. Another thing that could be put in play is that each of the students teachers should at least check his or hers grades every week. If there's a steady increase in the students grades then it's a high possibility that the student will"
Why Schools should not Force Kids to do Extracurricular Activity
"Most schools have something to do after school, like clubs, sports, or school performances."
"That's great that they have them, kids can make friends, and they can do what they like, but what if your Principal forced each student including you to do and extracurricular activity at the school."
"You might not be able to do it, or want to do it because, you might already have something after school to do that does not involve your school, you just don't want to do anything after school, and if it costs money your family might not be able to afford it."
"This is why disagree, with the Principals stupid policy on every student doing and extracurricular activity."
"You play Football every Tuesday, Thursday, and Saturday."
"So you do quite a bit of after school activities, but your Principal gives an e-mail to all parents."
From now on each and every student must participate in an extracurricular activity that is involved with the school.
"Now your in a pickle, you can't do 2 things since you don't manage your time well."
"Do you A join the schools crummy Football team, or B go against the Principle and stay with your Football team that is not involved with any school?"
"You choose B, and get in trouble for not choosing an extracurricular activity with the school."
Now doesn't this just sound stupid?
You get in trouble for not joining the school sports team.
This is 1 reason why schools should not force extracurricular activities onto students.
"Everyone in you life calls you lazy, and it's true you don't want to do anything, and you defiantly don't want to do anything after school, but then your parents get an e-mail."
From now on each and every student must participate in an extracurricular activity that is involved with the school.
You think oh no I don't want to do this.
But your parents sign you up anyway for an after school Book Club.
"You do not like their decision, and the schools choice to force kids into doing after school activities."
So you hatch a devious plan.
"You know your parents get home a bit after you do when you are doing Book Club, so you just skip Book Club, and take the bus home."
Your parents get a phone call that you were not at Book Club.
"You get punished by your parents, and by your Principal for skipping Book Club."
"This example is a little far-fetched but, some people just don't want to extracurricular activities."
"Finally, what if your family is living paycheck to paycheck, and you can't afford much, just necessities, and just maybe a little extra if it's a good week/month."
"Since you guys don't have a computer the school gives you a note to take home, and it says."
From now on each and every student must participate in an extracurricular activity that is involved with the school.
"You think yay this seems fun, oh and this too."
"But with your luck each thing has a fee to join, since you do get something for the activity."
"Since your on a tight budget, your parents say, ""No, we can't afford this."""
"Oh well, the Principal will understand."
You think but you have Generic_Name from
"Generic_Name as a Principal, and he does not care that you don't have money and can't afford to do and extracurricular activity."
So he lets you choose an activity you want to do.
"You choose an activity, and then he says, ""That's when you will have detention each day until the school year is over."
"Each time this activity is going on you will have detention!"" Then sends you out of his office."
"This also sounds very stupid, giving a kid detention because their family can't afford to pay the fee?"
"These reasons, you might already have an extracurricular activity, don't want to do one, or can't afford it, show my opinion on this and how I disagree with the Principals' idea of having each kid do an extracurricular idea."
"But if you want to do extracurricular activities that is always good, especially if your school has a sport you enjoy or good clubs to help you make friends, and work with people that are interested in the same stuff that you are."
"The face that you see on Mars is actually a landform called martian mesa. It just happened to form like a face with the shadow. When the viking 1 was looking for a landing spot for viking 2 it happened to fly over this landform the viking 1 was already taking pictures, so it took a picture of the land formation that looked like a face."
"When this picture was later given to the public to see it became a pop icon in a Hollywood film, book, magazines, and radio talk shows too. People believe that it is a sign of life on Mars and that NASA would rather hide conspiracy theorists, but really if there was life on Mars NASA wouldn't hide it they would be getting funding money for a mission to father investigate. Then on"
"April 5, 1998, a Mars orbiter flew over colonia capturing a sharper image of the landform it showed a martian mesa with shadows that made it look like a face as NASA said. Yet people were not happy they said it was cloudy on the red plant and that the camera had to take the picture thought clouds and could have missed alien life. So NASA then fleet over the landform one for time on cloudless day at the red plant and took another picture it showed the same thing as the second picture. So it was made clear that there was no alien life on arms or that the face of Mars was made by aliens it was just a great land forming."
"Some schools offer distance learning as an option for students to attend classes from home by way of online or video conferencing. I believe this is a good way to go around things for people that are disabled and can't walk or stand easily. Let's say you are disables and It's hard for you to walk and your school has stairs but no elevator. Instead of going to school, you can work on your school work at home and not have to worry about having to go up and down the stairs, or bumping into people while you go by."
"Being able to work on school while at home means you can have experience for when you have a job that you can work remotely for. For example lets say you want to become a proposal manager, and you are sick and cant go to work, You will have some experience with working from home and not getting distracted while working because you did it with school work. You will have the proper ability to be able to work and not have to worry if you are going to turn it in on time."
"Another example I'm going to explain is that you don't have to worry about not having enough time in class to work on a project or paper. When you are at home, you have a lot more time to work on one thing at a time and not have a time limit. So if you are scared that you will not have enough time to turn in the project while you are at school, if you're doing the online course you can work on it for a bit, switch over to another class if you need a break, then work on it more. You are not able to do that if you are at school its one subject at a time."
One downside to working at home is that you don't get to see your friends as often or make new ones. Because if you're at home and not at a public or private school you won't see new people as often as if you were going working at home. Making it difficult to make or see friends.
In conclusion if I had the option to work at home I would like to do it. Mostly because I suck at turning in things that are done while I have distractions at school from being with friends or people talking. So if there is an option to work on school at home I would take it.
"While for many years the traditional way of a class comprised of students physically being in the class to learn, now in the age of the internet students can participate in the classroom at home. People believe that students should still go to school, but students gain many benefits when they attend school at home because they have more personal time, have better attendance, and make schools less crowded."
"Students have been balancing school and after curricular activities for a long time now, but students would have more available time if they took online classes. Students can choose classes based on their own personal schedule. This would make it easier to balance their day because they can do there class before or after their activities. Also, the classes would be flexible unlike normal school where there is a fixed time one must be at school to learn, now it can change based on a student's daily tasks. If a student is late or sick one day instead of missing precious class time and material they now can catch up on later in the day without any backlash. Online classes would help give students more free time because the class depends on how fast a kid can learn and complete the material. If a student is really gifted they can learn and finish new material very quickly, which gives them more time to focus on their own lives and not about school. Traditionally in the classroom the teachers job is to make sure that all the students learn, therefore many times a handful of students would be ready to move on and learn, but the teacher cannot because there are other students who are behind. Online classes solve this by making it possible for a student to move on individually at what ever pace they need it to be. The introduction of online classes can gift a student with more time and freedom."
"When a student misses school they lose a lot of valuable learning but with online classes they will achieve a better attendance record. Online school makes it possible, so the classroom is where ever a student has a smart device with an internet connection. That means that whether a student is on vacation or is in a blizzard they can learn. The student will never have to miss another class because they are sick because they can even learn in their bed, this will severely cut down the attendance gap that many students have. Online schooling will decrease the rates that students skip. When a students skip school they would usually be able to make up the work the next day but with online classes they would stay at home and would have to complete their work or their grades would suffer, so this cuts down the days a student would be able to skip and not do any work. Online schooling helps coax kids into not skipping and pushes learning on the go, this drastically helps with missed time in the classroom"
"Many schools around the country are overcrowded but with online schooling taking kids out of the school majorly helps with overcrowding. When online schooling takes away kids from a school that is overcrowded it takes off the stress put on the education system there. This makes classrooms smaller and teachers more available to a smaller class but for more time. This also helps the students by making there school day more efficient. When a school gets smaller they can spread their resources more efficiently. Now not only do students at home who take online classes get benefits but also kids in schools. The school now has more money, time and availability to each individual student, which enriches their own learning. Online classes help take away students from schools and helps with overcrowding and in the process improve the learning of others."
"With the introduction of online learning, students in school or at home both receive great benefits that improve their educational experience. This happens through the process of giving students more time, keeping them in school, and relieving other schools of overcrowding. "
"I think we should change to election by popular vote for the President of the United States. I have a couple of reasons for saying that. First, under the electoral college system, voters don't vote for the president, they vote for a slate of electors who ends up voting for the president. Second, you have to worry about the ties in the electoral vote."
"First off, under the electoral college system, voters don't vote for the president, they vote for a slate of electors who ends up voting for the president. So that means you actually don't get to vote for the president you want, the electors get to vote for the president they want and their choice might not be the same as yours. Here's an example that was in Source 1, ""If you lived in Texas, for instance, and wanted to vote for [John] Kerry, you'd vote for a slate of 34 Democratic electors pledged to Kerry."" So you don't actually get to vote for a president. Also, in source 2, it states that the electoral college is unfair to voters because of how each state has the winner-take-all system, candidates don't spend time in states they know they have no chance in winning, focusing only on the tight races in the ""swing"" states."
"Second, you have to worry about the ties in electoral vote. Source 2 states that if a tie happens, the election would be thrown to the House of Representatives, where state delegations vote on the president. The senate would choose the vice-president. The state delegations may not vote for the president you want, and the senate may not vote for the vice-president you want either."
"I think the Electoral College process is a bad idea, and it should be changed to popular vote for the President of the United States. Electoral college is unfair to voters and I think it should be gotten rid of.  "
In society today transportation is necessary to keep most things going. Cars are one of the biggest transportation devices used. The advantages of limiting car usage range from taking away stress to lowering air pollution.
"Stress is one of the biggest factors faced while driving. Continuously having to check for cars around you, looking for open spaces to race by the car in front of you, and waiting in those horrible traffic jams that waste useful time in your life. Reducing the amount of car usage will lead to exercise which reduces stress and less waiting time for multiple things. As stated in source 1, paragraph 3 a resident of Vauban says ""When I had a car I was always tense."" Mentally driving is a lot to handle and always has you worried no matter how comfortable your car is."
"A huge problem in our environment today is air pollution. Reduced car usage leads to less gas having to be drilled from oil mines and places underground. It also comes with a bundle of less smog and a stronger, cleaner, atmosphere. Even a businessman in Columbia commented ""It's a good opportunity to take away stress and lower air pollution,"" in source 3 paragraph 24 as he participated in the annual car-free day. The better the environment and air pollution the healthier the oxygen."
Helping the Earth is essentially and will always be helping our selves.  
- The author does support the idea very well of studying Venus is worthy of pursuit despite the dangers.
"- Venus is a cloud draped planet, it is often referred as Earth's twin because Venus is the closest planet to Earth and sometimes Mars, humans sent spacecraft to Venus but unmanned because not one single spaceship has touched down in Venus in three decades, humans have to study everything about Venus because of Venus's reputation it is a very challenging planet."
"- Venus was used to be the most Earth-like planet in our solar system because long ago it was covered with oceans and could have supported various forms of life, just like Earth. Venus still has some features such as valleys, mountains, and craters. NASA has a compelling idea for sending humans to study Venus. Many researchers are working on innovations that would allow our machines to last long enough to contribute meaningfully to our knowledge of Venus."
"- NASA is working on other approaches to studying Venus. Striving to meet the challenge presented by Venus has value, not only because of the insight to be gained on the planet itself, but also because human curiosity will likely lead us into many equally intimidating endeavors."
"Success is about to be enforced our self and to accomplish our goals, as I know nobody was born knowing something everyone was born to learn and to fail every time that is possible to learn more However I agree with Churchill's statement that is about the important role that failure plays in the success, My reasons are that we can protrude, influenced others, more personal experience."
"My first reason is that everyone can protrude and be proud over our self, and protrude means to take the best of us and show it, for example, in my case lass year I lost my job because I didn't have enough age to work in the company this year I start my own company and I have my own employees, this is an example how failure didn't take my enthusiasm, and that we can lose twice maybe but not forever because be will be success later."
"My second reason is that our attitude is everything we can infuse others that have been losing their lives and their enthusiasm and show them that everyone can enforce and get what they want,"
"An example will be my cousin she had been in 12 grade for 3 years that at the first year that she didn't pass her grade herself confidence went down, and she had loss her goals, but this year she will graduate because this year she is being preparing to pass her classes and to get her diploma, this is an example of been failing, and failing and then get the success."
"Others might say that success and failing isn't good for our society, however I still disagree because to get success or to win we have to learn from the beginning, my third reason is that with the experience what we have of been losing and failure twice and twice we will know that we are going to do and be successful later. According to a quote that say ''You can lose a battle but not the war'', In fact we can lose everything but not our enthusiasm."
"In conclusion, this is why I agree with Churchill's statement that is about the important role that failure plays in the success, My reasons are that we can protrude, influenced others, more personal experience. Everyone is exerted to failure but what we have to do is to continue and don't surrender don't give up with our goals, always been happy doesn't pay attention to the situation."
"Dear, Principal"
Us students have a problem with the changes you are making in our school.
"We disagree with the not participate in sports or any activities unless we have at least a B average, many students in our school are great at playing sports and with many more activities, but the more students that have a c average many not participate in these activities."
"This is not fair to our school we will have a camp ain of student that are great at sports and activities and the once that are very smart to get together and study, so we can keep participating on these activities. We need this thing to keep us going in school for our health, trying something new, helping each other, being friendly with others, and making new friends, if you let this happen we would be on track with our school work and not giving up and trying our best to have and get a B average or even an A average, we will become successful by the time you approve of this letter, we took our time to write it, and we hope you will think about our deal."
We would be glad if you as our principal support us on this camp ain.
Thank You for your time.
"Sincerely, Your Students"
"Letting teachers design the project is the most ignorant design ever. Most students would hate to do a teacher design project. The projects should definitely be student design. I strongly believe a summer project is an intelligent way of letting students retain the information. However, it should be student design because they'd be more likely to do it, they'd understand the project more, and it gives them responsibility."
"Firstly, students would be more likely to participate in a student-designed project. A whole of students won't be pleased doing a summer project, so the least schools could do is let the students design the project. Also, some teachers make projects way too boring. So if the students design the project it'd probably be less boring for them. It'd be much better to let the students could be as creative as they want. When people find something boring they won't do it, especially young people. So letting the students design the project would increase the chances of the student passing the project."
"Secondly, the students would understand the project more. Some teachers make extremely confusing rubrics for the project. When teachers make confusing rubrics it causes a negative reaction to the students trying to complete the project. Some students would lose confidence in themselves on the project, which will increase their chances of failing. That would be a horrible start to the new school year. The goal is for students to pass not fail, and teacher design projects would really increase failing chances. Students will have a hard time passing something they don't understand, because like I said earlier; some teachers make really confusing project-designs."
"Lastly, is it gives the students more responsibility. Responsibility is one of the most important things a young person can learn. It helps with maturity & being a better adult. So the student would be responsible for the project & designing it. I know it's very little responsibility, however it does help."
"Projects should definitely be student designed. Student design projects teaches students more responsibility. Also, it would make students more likely to complete the project. If schools do make summer projects, I hope that they are student designed. "
"Sometimes classrooms can be very confusing to both teachers and students. With new computer software that can recognize emotions, the classroom environment can be greatly improved. The computer is able to detect a variety of different emotions from surprise and sadness. This advanced technology can help with students who are afraid of asking a question they think is dumb, students who don't care enough to ask questions, teachers detecting if a student is lying and exercises that have students fake emotions until they become real. The use of this technology would change students' and teachers' school experience."
"A quote by Prof. Thomas Huang says, ""a classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored. Then it could modify the lesson, like an effective human instructor."" With the Facial Action Coding System, computers would be very useful in the classroom because many students are too afraid to ask questions, or they just don't care enough to ask questions. With this new software computers can detect when a student isn't understanding the concept, bored with the lesson or completely zoned out. The teacher can also be aware of the class weaknesses and strengths. Knowing this feedback would create a better learning environment for the student and teacher."
"Going along with the idea of technology that reads your emotions, according to the Facial Feedback Theory of Emotion, moving your facial muscles not only expresses emotions, but also may even produce them. This exercise can be significant in the classroom by having the students fake emotions until the emotions become genuine. If students simply do smiling exercises before a test it could possibly relieve potential nerves, resulting in better test scores. This exercise could also be used when they are being taught a lesson. The student could practice a serious face multiple times until they feel serious enough to focus on the lesson. Advanced computers can read these emotions and detect whether these exercises were beneficial."
"""To an expert, faces don't lie; these muscle clues are sometimes used to spot when a ""smiling"" politician or celebrity isn't being truthful."" - Since this statement can be used during scenarios including politicians, it can be applied to everyday situations like students in a classroom. Things like cheating on tests, plagiarism and lying about getting work done in time are all common practices done by many students. With the use of the advanced technology, teachers can detect whenever either of those happen, thus bettering the student in the long run. This can also result in students never doing these things again because they know they will get caught."
"All of these claims are evidence that advanced technology would be very valuable in a classroom setting. If every school had these computers, the teachers' and students' learning environment would immensely improve. From knowing if a student is lying or not to teachers being able to better their lesson plans, this technology can do it all. Every schools' test scores would go up. Although this software is way beyond our time and a little too much to ask for, it would make school a better place.  "
"Driverless cars are becoming more popular in today's society. Driverless cars can be very useful to people today. They can help prevent many accidents on the roads today. They can be used by someone from every age group that is able to drive. Young adults, middle-aged people, and the elderly can all use the driverless car to help improve the roads in today's society."
"For example, many parents might feel better knowing that their child is on the roads using a driverless car that is less likely to cause an accident. Teen drivers today are distracted when they first begin to drive. With a driverless car, however, teens could possibly get distracted but would not cause an accident. The car could continue driving for them. If the cars could accelerate for the driver, they could also prevent the driver from speeding. This would prevent many young adults who are less experienced on the roads from being pulled over by a police officer and given a ticket. Many parents may also become distracted while driving with young children. Young children need attention from their parents, and while in a car children tend to distract their parents more often usual. When a parent looks away from the road and to the backseat where their child is sitting, even if they are only looking away for a few seconds, they could run into the oncoming lane of traffic or possibly a ditch. With driverless cars, these accidents could be prevented. As long as the parent or teenager has his or her hands on the steering wheel, the car will drive itself. With BMW's ""Traffic Jam Assistant"", the driver would be able to look away from the road and the car would still be able to steer, accelerate, and brake themselves. In case of a work zone or accident, the driver would be notified, and they would assert their attention back to the road. This ""Traffic Jam Assistant"" would be useful while a mother needed to tend to her child in the back seat or while a teenager talked on the phone to their friend. The driverless cars would not be just for teenagers and middle-aged people, they could be used by elders as well. Often you will hear on the news or radio about how an elderly person fell asleep at the wheel and rear-ended the car in front of them, sometimes causing a bad accident. With the driverless cars, elders could possibly fall asleep, or they could be just as distracted as a young adult on the road, and still not cause an accident. As you age, your senses start to dull and that impairs your driving. This could possibly cause an accident. With the driverless car, elders can still drive and not have their dulled senses impair their driving. Driverless cars could save many lives each year and prevent numerous accidents."
"Driverless cars could be a huge advance in today's society. Driverless cars are safer than a car driven by a person. They could possibly prevent accidents and many deaths each year. By using a car that could drive itself, you could make today's roads safer and easier to navigate. "
"The author supports his idea by giving many examples towards the text. He provide enough support towards his idea. The idea of studying Venus is worthy despite the dangers. With the information provide we can determine that the author gave enough reasons. For example ""These conditions are far more extreme than anything human encounter on Earth.""(para.3.) What It's trying to tell us is that Venus is a planet in which in life is nothing close to ours. The planet is during hot due to the fact it's closer to the sun. Explaining that life in Venus isn't possible human."
"Scientists take a big role, they are the ones that plan everything. The amount of time and effort placed into their work determines if we get to travel to Venus. For example ""scientists seeking to conduct a thorough mission to understand Venus would need to get UO close and personal despite the risks.""(para.6.) Getting up close and looking at the real thing there... standing in front of you, unsure on what to do. Everything around you looking brand new, that's what the scientists want, To be able to look at the Venus in person, the author supports this claim by supporting detail."
"After reading the passage I am able to infer the main idea, which was the author supporting his idea of Venus is worthy pursuit despite the dangers. The interface I was able to capture,""human curiosity will likely lead us into many equally intimidating endeavors.""(para.8.) This paragraph gives us the idea of us humans. We could be told one million times not to do something, but at the of the day we all end UO doing it like it or not."
"Dear TEACHER_NAME,"
"I really disagree with you. The reasons why I disagree with you are that you are making it too late a notice to change the requirements now, and it is really hard for kids to keep a B average if they have sports. By the time you read this letter I hope you keep the requirements the same."
"First off you are trying to change the requirements too fast. Statistics show that 85% of athletes on school teams have a C average. How are you supposed to play if u don't have enough players because they are not meeting the new requirements? That means that our school will have to forfeit many games because there are not enough players. A forfeit is a lost and I know you love sports, and you don't want our sports teams to lose. For example, our basketball and football teams have been undefeated for 5 years!!! If they forfeit they will end their winning streak."
"Secondly, how our you suppose to expect our players to practice and play their best trying to bring up their grades because you changed the requirements in the middle of the season. They would possibly have to miss some practices and forfeit some games just to bring up their grade. Also, having players focussing on their work and sports too much can put a lot of stress on them. It's not good to have stress as a teenager."
Now that you see my view I hope that you keep the requirements the same. Remember that it is too late of a notice and your players could have a lot of stress on them.
"Sincerely,"

"In 1976 NASA's Viking 1 took a photo of a landform that resembled a face. This excited the public. NASA has gone back to that place twice and taken higher definition photos to make sure that it is not a face or some monument made by aliens. They have fond that it is a common landform, a mesa or butte. If it were more, NASA would tell the public right away. News of life on Mars would excite the public, and provide NASA with funding for future explorations."
"The first photo of the landform was taken in 1976 by Viking 1. Each pixel in the photo represents 43 meters. It is difficult to see deities in this photo. NASA believed that it was their duty to make sure this was not a sign of extraterrestrial life. In 1998, Mars Orbiter Camera took a picture ten times sharper than the original. This picture showed more detail, but the public was not satisfied. In 2001 NASA took another photo of the spot. In this photo a pixel is equal to 1.56 meters. This image is so sharp that if anything unusual were there, you could see it."
"Mesas are a common landform in that area. Colonia, where the Face is located has lots of other landforms like mesas and buttes. Simpler landforms are also found on earth. Landforms come in all different shapes and sizes, and this one happens to resemble a face. That is not unusual, we like to find thing that look like other things. For example, you might see a cloud and say it looks like a bunny. Likewise, we see a landform and say it resembles a face."
"The Face, ""a huge rock formation...resembles a human head"", but this is pure coincidence. The shape of the formation forms shadows giving the illusion of eyes, a nose, and a mouth. NASA has taken very detailed photographs to make sure there is no alien life. The Face on Mars is a mesa or butte, a common formation. If there was life on Mars NASA wouldn't hide it, it would excite people about space and provide money for future explorations."

"I was regarding your ideas for allowing or banning cell phones at your school. The policy that I think would be best is allowing the students to bring their cell phones, but they MUST be turned off during class time. They may use their cell phones during only free periods, lunch, or before school (if the student is on campus), and as long as they are not a nuisance or used in any inappropriate manor."
"This policy could make coming to school a more exciting thing for students, and could make them more motivated to learn. Technology is a big thing that students enjoy using, and they would be allowed to bring there enjoyment to school. Another good reason why this policy would work so well involves the student's parents/guardian. If a student has an accident with their clothes, then they could contact there parents, and ask them to bring them a pair of clean clothes, (with office approval of course)."
"Cell phones can also help new students that have cell phones, so that they can keep in touch with old friends, or relatives, and they will be able to have someone to talk to at their lunch. They won't just have to sit around by themselves, and they won't just have to sit their without talking to anyone. This policy is also a way for students to make new friends, and they are able to exchange numbers and to keep in touch, or to hang out with after school hours. Cell phones can also help students that enjoy doing there homework at free periods, and then they can check their work on the calculators provided in most cell phones."
"In conclusion, the policy to allow cell phones at your school is the only right choice for you to make. It can help make new friends, make coming to school fun, and can help keep students in touch with their parents and friends at all times. This policy is can also help the new students who never really enjoy coming to a new school, but in some ways, they can still keep in touch with their old friends. I hope you consider my choice, and use this policy for your school to keep your students learning, while still having fun when they come to school."

"It was actually quite simple to see that it was not created by aliens. If you look at the pictures, it acts as if it was like any other landform on earth. As humans, our mind is very good at creating a false idea because we want it to be it is that way. However, it is clearly shown that the faces were not created by aliens."
"In the pictures shown in the article, the face changes as any fossil or landmark would on Earth. The jump from 1976 to 2001 is a big chance of what it would look like if it were on Earth. As said in the article, the JPL website says it was a natural landform, not an alien monument. The only reason that the rumors of alien monuments still existed is because there were people who were still not satisfied."
"Another reason that the alien monument rumors were false is because even with a cloudless day in Colonia, it still appeared as a natural landform. Granted, the rumors of clouds blocking the actual image of the face was a logical argument. However, they even took pictures on a cloudless day, and it still appeared as a natural landform."
"The theory that this was an alien civilization is totally inaccurate. The pictures clearly show the actions of the face. Just because our imagination can create false ideas of life on another planned, the evidence shows that acts and looks as a natural landform.  "
"I think this council is debating the adoption. If the curfew adopt the teenagers, the situation will change to the better. The council said the teenagers don't have to be in the street after 10 p. m. in the weekdays because they want the teenagers out of troubles. And they found teenagers in the street after 10 P.M. that's mean is breaking the law. That warning for the people because sometimes the bad people walk around have a knife or have a gun these people can kill someone kidnapping anyone. Or someone make a bomb and try to put it in street. And also is danger because maybe someone drank a lot, and he drove the car maybe can hit anybody by the car that's why the police check the city a lot of time to make sure no bad things will happen, and also the police check the city because if someone has something wrong they will help them. If the teenagers don't break the law this will help the police to try to make the city safe the safety in city is so important. Like example that happen to me when I was 15 years old I was walking in the street at 11 p. m. and I was going to my home I see one man behind me, but I thought is regular man, but he was a knife, and he said to me give anything you have I was had my wallet had on it my ID and not too much money and I don't have anyone in the street to help me, and he took my phone, and he told me leave and don't look behind you, I ran away because he was almost going to kill me. Be in your home early to be safe. The police doesn't want to control on you, but he wants to be safely. Because the world is not safe now the world have a lot of bad people. And also I was had my friend was in street at 1 a. m. and someone was drank and hit my friend by the car. And my friend is dead all of these to show you how the world is not safe. The police have a lot of situations with the bad people. And if you look at the countries is not safe the reason is that every day around the country you will find everyday someone killed. That's tells you how the world is not safe. A lot of people dead because of the people is drank, or the has a gun or knife. If you search in internet about the people is succeeded in their life the internet will show you these people focused in their future when they finish their work the going to their home to take a rest. Try to make your schedule early like in the midday in the morning to go to your home early."
"A lot of people kidnapped every day make sure you're safe. And also I saw before a guy have a gun, and he stopped a girl and his husband and he took from them the all gold that girl has it, and he took the wallet from the man. And if you don't care about yourself no someone will care about you keep yourself safe. Your life is expensive to don't make your life is free for someone."
"Did you know in 1976 a picture was taken of a ""face"" on Mars?"
"Most people believe that it is a sign that there is life on Mars or a sign of aliens. But, people who agree with NASA know it is actually just a mesa. There are two sides to this picture of a ""face"" either you think it is a sing of life or it is a mesa. So, the figure similar to a face isn't a face because it is similar to landforms on Earth, the figure is too big to be a real face, and it is actually a mesa."
"Matter of fact, the figure/landform on Mars similar to a ""face"" is a lot like landforms on planet Earth. For example,""'It reminds me most of Middle Battle in the Snake River Plain of Idaho,' says Gavin.""(12) This quote provides evidence that the figure/landform on Mars is similar to landforms on Earth. So, this is evidence that the figure on Mars is just a landform like what we have on Earth."
"Next, the figure similar to a ""face"" is too big to be a real face. For example,""An enormous head nearly two miles from end to end.""(1) This quote shows that the head is too big to be a real face. Like, what face is two miles long from end to end?"
"Last but not least, the figure/landform similar to a ""face"" is actually a mesa! For example,""What the picture actually shows is the Martian equivalent of a butte or mesa - landforms common around the American West.""(12) This quote proves that the figure/landform is just a mesa. There is no life on Mars or aliens making signs. It is simply just a common landform."
"Finally, the figure/landform similar to a face isn't a face. It isn't a face because it is a common landform on Earth. It is way too big to be a real face. Also, the figure/landform is simply just a mesa. These are all reasons and proof that the landform on Mars isn't a sign of life or aliens it is just a common landform."
"Dear principle,"
"You think that we should have to have a letter B grade or above to play sports. I do not agree with you because below a B is not failing. Below a letter C grade is failing and UIL states that you must be passing to play, and a C is passing you do not have the authority to do that. It is okay to have a C"
"Because some kids might not be very good at school, they have other activities that consume most of there time, and again you do not have permission to make this a rule."
"Some of us have many other activities outside of school that we are occupied with and take a lot of time and effort. Some nights I do not get home from Boy Scouts until 9:00, and I will be tired, go to bed, and forget to study. The next day I might have a test that fail because I did not study, and it will hurt my grade. I should still be able to play because I could get a better grade on the next assessment, and it will bring my grade up."
"Some of the kids who play sports a lot are not very good at school, and they average a C in most classes. I can see why you would want to motivate these few to bring their grades up, but you can not do that by saying they can not play unless they have a B. UIL says they must have a C or above at report card time to be able to play, not just doing bad on a test."
"In conclusion, you should be able to a C average or above to play sports because some kids might have other time-consuming activities and others are not willing to put forth the effort to get a B. That is why I disagree with you."

"Dear Senator,"
"While it is unfair, the Electoral College should still be used. There are some problems with the way it works, but it would still be easier than having presidential elections by popular vote."
"One of the reasons why the Electoral College should still be used is the certainty of the outcome. A dispute over the outcome of an Electoral College vote is possible - it happened in 2000 - but it's less likely than a dispute over the popular vote. The reason is that the winning candidate's share of the Electoral College invariably exceeds their share of the popular vote. Because almost all states award electoral votes on a winner-take-all basis, even a state creates a landslide electoral-vote victory in that state. A tie in the nationwide electoral vote is possible because the total number of votes - 538 - is an even number, but it is highly unlikely."
"Secondly, the Electoral College restores some weight in the political balance that large states (by population) lose by the virtue of the mal-apportionment of the Senate decreed in the Constitution. So, other things being equal, a large state gets more attention from presidential candidates in a campaign than a small state does. The Electoral College also avoids the problem of elections in which no candidate receives a majority of the votes cast. There is pressure for run-off elections when no candidate wins a majority of the votes cast; that pressure, which would greatly complicate the presidential election process, is reduced by the Electoral College, which invariably produces a clear winner."
"At the most basic level, however, the Electoral College is unfair to voters. Because of the winner-take-all system in each state, candidates don't spend time in states they know they have no chance of winning, focusing only on the tight races in the ""swing"" states."
"Aside from it being a little unfair, the Electoral College does its best to elect a President, which is why it should still be kept.  "
"Whether we have our license or not, we can all relate to the stress of the daily commute. As of the past century, cars have been one of the most efficient ways to get from point A to point B. Now, mainly due to air pollution, there has been a noticeable decline in the amount of cars used for travel. The advantages of limiting car usage include less stress, less air pollution, and an overall improved society."
"The stress of traffic and the constant pressure to be on time would be significantly reduced if people chose other means of transportation such as riding a bike, taking public transportation such as the subway or bus, or walking. Source 1 shows just how effective decreased car usage can be. It describes Vauban, Germany, a small suburb community in which there is virtually no car usage. Many citizens report being less tense, as everything is made within means of walking-distance."
"Another cause of stress from car usage is the effects it has on the atmosphere. Passenger cars are responsible for 12 percent of the greenhouse gas emissions in Europe and 50 percent in some car-intensive areas in the United States.(Source 1) Paris is an excellent example of just how much car usage has had such negative effects on the atmosphere. Source 2 explains how Paris was so smog ridden it rivaled Being, China. Paris then placed limits on car usage until the smog cleared enough for the ban to be lifted."
"Not only does decrease car usage help the planet, it helps society as a whole. Source 3 describes Bogotá, Columbia and how it celebrates one day a year of no car usage. The city has found that not only has this policy helped clear the smog, but it is enthusiastically endorsed by the citizens. Most people turned out to see the bike races, despite the occasional rain showers. This has caused two other Colombian cities, Cali and Valledupar to join the event. Bogotá has seen the construction of 118 bike paths, the most of any Latin American city. It is not just the government endorsing decreased car usage but people themselves. Source 4 points out how the number of miles driven per person was 9 percent below the peak. There are various explanation for why people are driving less, one might be that the internet makes increased telecommuting possible and allows people to feel more connected without having to drive to them."
"It is evident that we are witnessing a major cultural shift, possible depressing, but in the best possible way. The decreased incline to drive has resulted in less air pollution, a less stressed population, and an improved society overall.  "
"A new technology called the Facial Action Coding System allows computers to read human emotions has recently been invented. It works by recreating the human muscular motions in the face that are characteristic of certain emotions. Although this technology that allows computers to read emotions may seem irrelevant, ultimately the technology could potentially improve the way that students learn, and help students with social problems that they may have in school."
"To begin, the Facial Action Coding technology can be used to tell whether a student is understanding a topic. According to Dr. Huang, a professor of the Beckman Institute for Advanced Science at the University of Illinois, ""A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored..."" (6). This would allow the instructor to alter the way that they teach the topic to better convey the message. This can also be used when a student needs some kind of stimulation to be able to focus on class. The author Nick D'Alto also states that the ""software can also identify mixed emotions"" (4). This would allow the teachers to see the students who are stressed and confused and those who are happy and excited. When a student is confused or stressed, the teacher can provide additional practice or tutoring in that subject. The information that a teacher can receive from the software in very valuable. Humans can read emotions to a certain extent, but some people are good at hiding how they really feel and this can be detrimental to their education. Dr. Huang states"" most human communication is nonverbal, including emotional communication"" (6). By enabling teachers to use the technology, they can offer assistance to a student who may not ask for it otherwise."
"In addition, students can benefit from this technology in the social environment. According to Dr. Huang ""The facial expressions for each emotion are universal"" (4). This means that if a student were getting bullied, but they were hiding it, the teachers could find out the information quickly and help the student figure out what is going on. When a student is identified as being sad or depressed, the computer could show funny pictures to help the student feel better. In fact, ""according to the Facial Feedback Theory of Emotion, moving your facial muscles not only expresses emotions, but also may even help produce them"" (9). This means that by smiling, the students will actually make themselves feel better."
"Overall, the use of Facial Action Coding technology is very beneficial. Whether it be from a strictly educational standpoint, or from the social environment side, the results are in favor of improving the school experience of students."
I would agree with the decision to make all students participate in after school activity. I would agree with this decision for a couple of different reasons. One of them would be bringing people together. Parents may start to think and appreciate the teachers more for going above and beyond staying after school to work with their kids. This would paint a new path and a new picture for the schools future.
"Not only would extracurricular activities get more students and teachers working together forming good relations, but it would help students see teachers and the school in a new light. Students may start to appreciate there teachers more and may start to like them. Students could feel more confident with their teachers because they share some of the same interests. Not only this but the teachers may get to see how hardworking there students are working outside of school, and maybe the students just need a push or in other words a bit of help."
I feel like parents also would appreciate getting the kids off there butts and getting them to interact with their fellow teachers and students. By making encouraging there kids to have an open mind about after school activities they could also find out what there schools offer and possibly the parents could be interested. The students who look at taking after school activities with a good attitude will get hooked and find something they really enjoy. When the students come home from there extracurricular activities they could tell there parents all about it and maybe teach there parents something they don't know.
"When you sign up or good to an after school activity try and go with at least one friend who is also interested in the same topic. This will give you a safe feeling, and you will have someone to share the fun with you! Not only will you have one friend there but if you bring a friend there is a 100% chance you will make more friends there. The teachers will find it very exciting you found an extracurricular activity you enjoy and made new friends. With all the work you will be doing in your after school activity at least when it gets hard you will have a friend next to you to make it better."
"In conclusion, I think this is a very positive decision made by the principal and agree with it completely. There are so many benefits to going to after school activities. Meeting new people and finding interests you may have never new about. For all you know you could have found a career you love and want to do as a job. Finding new friends and meeting new teachers and strengthening you relationship with your teachers is a very smart thing to do. I would highly recommend other schools to do the same as this school and help your students find an activity they love."
"Venus is dangerous, and scientist cant get close enough to study it. Scientist is to just study Venus but cause of its crushing atmosphere and hot temperatures and whether. Scientist can't get close enough to the planet to study it, so they are trying to create a solution on how to. The scientist already know if they get to close to the planet will crush them and if it is possible to land it is way too hot. So scientist have come up with a solution thinking if they can hover over the planet will they be able to study it."
"Scientist believes that Venus once used to thrive with life. Scientist believes that Venus many years ago Venus had oceans with life like earth. And also that Venus is close to the same size as Earth along with Mars. And that's why they may believe it had some life on the planet. They have made some electronics to go along with Venus harsh conditions, but it is said that it only lasted 3 weeks. So they are trying something old called mechanical computers."
"These mechanical computers and stand harsh conditions such as pressure, heat, and other forces. The mechanical computers are more powerful flexible and quick they played an important role in the 1940s of World War 2. Since electronics cannot stand harsh conditions of Venus they are using something that does not require it. The mechanical computer only uses gears and levers which makes it good for the job. As the scientist work on it, they are taking it on as a challenge to see the surface of Venus."
"Do you think all kids should have to do an extracurricular activity for school? I think having extracurricular activities is good to have in schools because it gives kids the chance to do different things they want to do. I also think schools should encourage students to do extracurricular activities. However, I do not think students should be forced to do an extracurricular activity at school because they might be too busy with there school work, they might have an after school job, and they could already be doing an extracurricular activity outside of school."
"My first reason why students shouldn't be forced to do extracurricular activities is because they might be to busy with school work at home. Teachers give out a lot of homework in each class and some students need a lot of time to do it. Making them do an activity after school, that they probably don't even want to do, might give them a hard time because then they might not get there homework done. If they manage to do the activity and get there homework done then they might get to bed later than usually then they will not be able to do there best the next day and all the days after."
My second reason why students shouldn't be forced to do an extracurricular activity is because they might have a job after school. Even if the activity that student joined only meets once a week they still might need to work that day and can't request off. They also might have the job because they need to help provide for their families. You never know what a student goes through outside of school.
My last and finally reason why students should not be forced to do an extracurricular activity is because what if they are already doing one outside of school. A lot of students are already doing something they want to do outside of school and if they get forced to do an extracurricular activity in school they wouldn't have enough time for the one there doing outside of school. They shouldn't have to quit one they might have been doing there whole life with friends they love to start a whole new one. It wouldn't be fair to the student.
"In conclusion, students shouldn't have to do extracurricular activities because they might not have time to do one because of personal reasons. They might have to help provide for there family because there parents can't, they might need extra help with school and have a tutor help them every day, or they might already be doing an extracurricular activity outside of school. You do not know what they do when they aren't at school. Therefore, you can't make them do things that they might not be able/want to do.  "
"I stand with the making of these cars and the possibilities that come with in our society. The cars would be able to open new doors to health benefits, lowering crash ratios, and much more. The driverless car would be a great achievement in human curiosity and invention. These cars would better many levels of society if made and used properly."
"Driverless can be an innovation within our communities and cites. These cars could protect more lives and lower the amount of human recklessness that could be done at the wheel of a regular driven car. If made fully driverless, the amount of intoxicated accidents, killing and pull-overs by the police would be lowered substantially. These smart cars could detect when their driver is not keeping a minimal amount of focus on the road and alert them to any dangers that could obstruct their path or cause harm. Only increasing the level of safety and efficiencies that it would be used for."
"The support of the driverless car, though at the moment is not completely driverless, could keep many citizens safe and out of harm. The public eye sees these cars of dangerous because they do not wish to relinquish their right of control over to the car, and also they do not know what would replace the fun of driving in its stead. The makers have a few ideas on how to make the trip fun, but still lawmakers are trying to decide whether to trust that these cars are really that safe and how big their laws would need to change for traffic, and the last big question who will take the blame for a crash that may happen. The safety issues are slowly being proven to the lawmakers on that it may be a better option then regular cars, but the other previously said designs have yet to be acted upon, except for its questioning."
"I do believe driverless cars if thought through and corrected for mistakes can become a valuable asset to modern day community. These cars could lead to an increase in driving, and traveling for families and could also lead to the question of what can we do with this technology now? I feel that these questions are a very good thing in the advancing technology of this age and that the still developing cars should not be frowned upon, but seen as a step forward into automating our country."
Phones and Driving
"Many people use their phones while they are driving. Almost 390,000 injuries occur each month due to distracted drivers. People should not be allowed to text and drive! Because it puts others in physical danger. We can stop this from happening by having the laws against phones more heavily enforced and discourage cell phone usage by producing a Bluetooth software to use hands-free across every device."
"Furthermore, individuals who disobey the law and keep using their device on the road should have to pay a fine for putting other drivers in danger. If the problem is still occurring after the fine, they should get to face jail time or pay the fine with an added $100. The final step in stopping phone users behind the wheel is that they should lose their license for a year. Hopefully, this will be an efficient way to stop distracted drivers from losing their focus on the road by using their devices."
"Also, phone companies should be directed to add safe driving features to help keep the public safe, which will in turn bring down the death rates from people using their phones and driving. Companies should encourage safe driving by making a system that makes answering calls and replying to text messages with your voice to minimize the loss of concentration due to the loss of focus on the road. It would be beneficial to make hands-free devices mandatory before they go to the market."
"All in all, stopping phone usage on the road is beneficial. Creating hands-free phones by all phone companies should be a safety demand required by the law. The number of offenses on the new law should be up to 5 offenses each month. When you are in trouble for using your phone while driving by the law with an offense, you should lose your driver's license for up to a month along with additional taxes to teach you a lesson. If these actions are carried out properly, up to 421,000 road incidents related to distracted drivers could be prevented each year.  "
"If people in the world can make a car capable of driving around elders, alcoholics, druggies, mobilized, and more; that car deserves to be given a chance. The ""Driverless Car"" will reduce car crashes, gas, money on transit, and will be able to mobilize the mobilized. People's lives around the world would change for the better; and that's why this car should be used."
"There are hundreds of car crashes everyday around the world due to careless drivers. Using the ""Driverless Car"", crashes could be significantly reduced if not gone. This car could also take a normal tank of gas and cut it in half. With these two benefactors, pollution would be drastically reduced due to fewer fumes in the air due to gas and leakage when a crash happens. These would all be important factors people have to think about when buying a car, and they should want the one that has the power to help the Earth. In the reading the narrator tells the readers that ""He believes such cars would fundamentally change the world."""
"Using this car means that the average person can now save money on transit. Then people wouldn't have to spend as much money filling up the tank of their cars or spend half of their paycheck for a car payment just to get from point a to point b. The narrator exclaims to the readers that, ""He envisions a future with a public transportation system where fleets of driverless cars form a public-transport taxi system."" If these cars start being used, buses would soon disappear; making the air safer to breath due to the Diesel gas and the pollution buses set off."
"Lots of people who are not able to drive take the bus, this may be because in their town there are not taxis. There are people who are mobilized due to not own a vehicle because they're too expensive; or that they could have a medical condition where they cannot drive. These people now will not have to worry about making it to the bus stop on time or making sure the bus is going where they need to be. People could then save time of being on a bus for an hour, to go somewhere 10 minutes away; and be able to be picked up at their doorstep and dropped off at their destination. The narrator tells the readers that, ""The cars he foresees would use half the fuel of today's taxis and offer far more flexibility than a bus."""
"These cars would make the lives of everyone a lot more simple and efficient. Imagine a world with no traffic because there are no accidents; a world without pollution due to less gas use and buses, and a world where everyone has more money to spend on their families and on themselves. Mobilized people could then feel more independent because they could then get themselves around. The world would be much better off using the ""Driverless Car"", it would be a perfect way to keep the Earth revolving."
"When asking for advice, you probably stumbled upon talking to one person or another. You should talk to more than one person at a time when asking for advice from others. It is good to do this because you can get different opinions on the subject and what to do according to it. This also helps build social skills and problem-solving skills, both being needed to obtain better life choices. But when asking advice from other people, don't do just one and have an isolated one-sided opinion, instead, ask more than one person to get a more accurate choice on specific subjects."
"If you're a nervous kind of person who doesn't have the courage to talk to others, practice talking often to improve yourself, so you can ask anything, anytime, without going through an emotional breakdown. And plus, even if you ask one or two people, you still could have a slightly biased opinion. That's why you should ask about 5 to 7 people on the subject of choice to get a true non-biased, open, honest opinion. Also, certain subjects require more or less people. Asking if you can eat something could just require only 1 to 3 people."
"Even asking a lot of people on subjects count as big social interaction which is a great way to get into a job, or even start a business! Jobs especially, requires being socialite to even have a chance in getting the position of the job of your choice. But it all starts with asking before taking action. But it is best to seek out many opinions to get your own. For example, video game designers have to ask probably thousands of people before even getting close to releasing your games."
"You always have to be sure to ask a lot of people, so you won't do something bad and lead your life into total plummeting chaos and despair. Getting more and more opinions could lead not only to better choices, but to a better life in general. You should ask for advice by asking as many people as you can (usually about 5-7 people), for you might just be able to get a truthful opinion that only you can describe as well as being social. Some more beneficial include having more of a variety of opinions to create an opinion of your choice which can prepare you for real life problems that you need to be prepared for."
"Dear Principal i think every student should do some community serves. Because instead of wasting their time staying home and playing video games, watching T. V they could be helping other people that need their help. They could at least help clean up the park by picking up trash and recycle plastic water bottles. They play in the park to, so they should help clean it in keep it nice. Or they could help at a shelter helping people that need food or cloths. Since they live in this community I think they should help it in take part in it. They could also help a small kid by tutoring them in help them understand something they don't get at school. They shouldn't be foolish and help around because helping around in our community is very important. Even if they only do it for a few hours at least they did something that made the community better. Just by giving a little pit of there time to do something helpful. By doing it makes you feel good about our selves knowing that you did something good. It also teaches us a Lesser not to be foolish and help out ones a wile."
"The development of driverless cars is a unique and interesting topic. The driverless cars would come with many pros, and cons. From making a living off of them to the cities and counties using them to benefit the citizens."
"My belief among with many others is that as a country we do not need any more reasons for us Americans to be lazy. Although I believe that there would be astonishing benefits with the Firefighters/Paramedics using this equipment, there should also be limitations. ""There cars have driven more than half a million miles without a crash."" This show that there is obviously some reliability behind these machines. They should be used for the elderly, wonded veterans, and emergency response teams. Although they should not be used for just a lazy or overweight person that wants to take the easy way out. In my personal opinion, and assuming it is for the use of a healthy person they should not be allowed. The furthest it should go for the average person is as the car had its own little autopilot for long rides and so on."
"I would like to further research theses cars before I can give an educated opinion, but from what I have learned from this article is that I am against Driverless cars. It will cause more trouble than helpfulness."
People should join the Seagoing Cowboys program because this program helps other countries during World War 2. We help these countries with their supplies.
We went to these countries when the Pacific war was over. Our ship even provided us something to pass time. This is why I think you should join the program.
"The UNRWA hires Seagoing Cowboys to help take care of animals before we get to the countries. To pass time you would play table-tennis tournaments, fencing, boxing, reading, whittling, and games. You are able to do a lot of sightseeing, like seeing Europe and China, or seeing the Acropolis in Greece. You help countries with their food supplies, animals, and more. Furthermore, you even talk with people with other nations that help you."
"This is why I think you should join the UNRWA. You are able to see Europe and China. You help other countries recover their supplies. Furthermore, you talk to other people from other nations. This is your opportunity of a lifetime."
Many people hid there emotions while others are very open. When someone smiles does that really mean they are happy or is it just a mask concealing their true emotions. Not many people are very open even with themselves. When times were simpler people how either hid there emotions or speak freely about them. Now in this new day and age a man named Prof. Thomas Huang of the Beckman institute has created a machine that can tell what you are feeling even if you are hiding it.
"I am for the value of using this technology to read students emotional expressions. The reason I am for and not against is that this machine can actually save lives. For those who pretend to be happy and are actually depressed they the machine can pick that up and that person/student can get the help and treatment they need. This can help because this machine can detect ""happiness, surprised, anger, disgust, fear and sadness."""
"This can be found in paragraph 3. With this new technology it observes the face that will look at your face and look at all the muscles in the face and calculate it to see how you are feeling even if you try and hid it. Everything is about the muscles in your face that can conduct how you are feeling. In this article it talks about how they tested this by using video imagery where they had people use a computer, and they would flash pictures and the device would examine the face to see how they were feeling. They had done this a few times to test it."
"In conclusion, they should use this to read students emotions because they maybe depressed, and it could save lives. If someone is to angry they could harm someone but with this new technology this can prevent many things like that. They can detect things like emotions because the machine looks at the muscles on the face to determine weather you are sad, happy, angry etc.;"
"Dear Senate,"
"I think we should change the election by popular vote, because with the electoral college not everyone is getting to vote like they should be doing. The Electoral College selects the electors, so the candidates are going to choose the electors that have things in common with them, so they win the election. Voters vote for a slate of electors, they don't get to vote for President."
"The Electoral College is unfair because the winner-take-all system makes it, so candidates don't spend time in the states they know their not going to win. The Electoral College consists of 538 electors, and you need at least 270 votes to elect the President. The Electoral College process is so much more complicated and long than popular vote, so why do we still use the Electoral College? We shouldn't."
"I'm not the only one that thinks this way. Richard Nixon, Jimmy Carter, Bob Dole, and so many more people think that we should abolish the Electoral College. And soon it's going to get to out of hand and then were not going to have a President. Their going to make it, so the Electoral College votes for everything! Abolish it!"
"What is the electoral college? Is when the people vote for meeting the President and Vice President of the college, is a process, not a place and is an election of the president by a popular vote of qualified. The opinion of people is that is a good form of meeting a President and Vice President the reason for is good an electoral college is that having of discussion the work and your can see from who vote."
"One of the reason of What is the electoral college? Is that having of discussion the work. According to the lecture"" "
Does the Electoral College Work?
(source1:What is the electoral college?)
""" Say that "" For this reason, in the following discussion, the word ""state"" also refers to the District of Columbia."". Is that take one refers the District of Columbia that now is a bag idea they is a good idea. The conclusion is that is good that saying the discussion of the work and that your can see from who vote."
"One of the reason of What is the electoral college? Is that your can see from who vote. According to the lecture"" "
Does the Electoral College Work?
(source1:What is the electoral college?)
""" Say that ""The Electoral College consists of 538 electors. A majority of 270 electoral votes is required to elect the President. Your state's entitled allotment of electors equals the number of members in its Congressional delegation: one for each member in the House of Representatives plus two for your Senators...."" . No to all people that like this because no feel separate for this so for this no vote. And the concluding for this reason is that now is only good knowing the discussion of the work that is good your can see from whom not and feel separate for take a decision."
"More people say that no have a problem if you have or no have a President or Vice president, this is no good because a President take decision important and the Vice President help to President to take this decision. For this have taken good decision in the moment of the vote. The presidential election is held every four years on the Tuesday after the first Monday in November."
The conclusion of this is that know of discussion of work and know for you one vote and this according hint this.  
"I believe that students attending school from home will benefit for many reasons. Students who experience anxiety attacks, depression, bullying, or just not being able to attend school for the day will find great use in online school, they can connect with their classes or teachers without being in school and not have to miss out on important information or work. Students are able to be in a safe environment at home if they do not feel comfortable in school."
"Furthermore, students with anxiety or depression may have a harder time going throughout the school day then their peers. For example, my girlfriend who has very often panic attacks, dislikes attending her current school. She was a new transfer student to the school and was also new to the school itself. She found it hard to not have anybody to go to and vent during the school day which causes her to stress and have anxiety. Moreover, she gets very often panic attacks during the day which makes her not want to come to school more often. She finds it easier and safer to stay at home. When ever we're on the phone over face time, she's always doing her class work that she takes home to complete. She's a hardworking student and always does her work but because of the environment she's in, it limits her on what she is capable of."
"Not only that it would help students feel secure, but for the students who are sick for the day and cannot attend school, wouldn't have to miss out on important information or work. For example; there are days when I just feel weak and tired, but I wouldn't want to miss a review day for a major test the next class. If there was online school, I would be able to connect with my teacher and the classes from home where I feel comfortable. Also, my mom wouldn't have to worry that I'm failing my classes because I'm not showing up to them. I believe that other students would agree with me on this argument because almost everyone I know, wishes they could attend school from home."
"Moreover, adults might not have knowledge of this, but let me tell you; there are a lot of drama and rumors in every high school. No matter where it is, the policies it has, the advances of the students, there is drama. And drama is one major factor on why students wishes to attend school at home. Just Imagine the advances of our present civilization if there was no drama at school, and no have you heard this or have you heard that. Drama and rumors are big time distractions to daily school work, and it peaks the interest of every student. By enabling online school, students dedicated to become scholars are able to take this distraction out of their equation. They can attend school without dealing with the big mouths talking up and down and all around the school."
"Overall, distance learning has a very good impact on the students. Students feel safer at home, and when they are sick or cannot attend school for they day, they wouldn't have to miss out on important information or work. Online school would be very beneficial for everyone."
"People With cars, don't actually use cars any more they chose to give up on them because Many have no place to park on the city outskirts and many sell their cars to live in Vauban. Others don't really own cars. People where more happy with walking. Less auto use was labeled as"" smart planning."" the planned to make less car space and more space for walking in the city. Stores are being placed in less s walk away on a main street besides in malls that's far on a highway. They promote new cities that are less car dependent. So there's more walking."
"In Paris, France they band cars because of air pollution. Citizens with odd and even numbered licenses plated had to pay a fine of 31 dollars as a fine for car pollution. Citizens that disapproved of the fine had their cars impounded. The smog was rivaled form the most polluted city in the world Beijing, china. In France more cars where used on diesel. Paris has more smog than others cities in Europe. Jobs that made deliveries complained because they couldn't deliver packages to their receivers. They started to come up with cars that's doesn't run on gas ...that can be just charged with a plug-in. Public transportation was free from Friday to Monday."
"Colombia used a car-FREE day to avoid traffic jams. Buses ANF taxis were only allowed to be along the city that day. The day was promoting the reduce of smog, people who disagreed always paid a fine of 25 dollars.  "
After a long argument with one of my co-workers deciding whether the Face on Mars was made by the aliens or the picture was a picture of a natural landform we both had different opinions on what we thought it really was.
My co-worker tried to convince me that aliens put the Face on Mars. He told me that by the looks of the picture it looked as if it was an alien artifact. He then stated that you could barely tell from the picture what exactly it is.
"I told him I thought it was a natural landform that either looks like a butte or a mess. I also stated that the picture actually shows a Martian that kinda looks like a butte or mess. Furthermore, I then stated that the picture reminds me somewhat of a Middle Butte in the Snake River of Idaho."
"He then decided that we should try and attempt to take a better and that we would decide from there. He sent Michael Main and his Mars Orbiter Camera team to snap a photo ten times as sharp as the last one. Furthermore, he then decided that I was right and that he was wrong because when the image first appeared on web surfers it revealed a natural landform. The picture also revealed that there was no alien monument to be seen after all."
"In conclusion, after the long argument we both agreed with my opinion. So it turns out that my co-workers opinion wasn't true. And we found out after taking the last photo that the Face of Mars came to be a natural landform."
"With the advancement of technology and increased accessibility of the internet comes many possible positive changes. One of these possible positive changes is distance learning: a way to attend school from home through online conferences. Some schools offer this new way of learning, but should more schools transfer to this method? Schools should implement distance learning into their curriculum because it will benefit students by being extremely convenient, providing a comfortable setting, and creating a safer community."
"Distance learning is very convenient. Say someone misses a school day because of sickness. Well, with distance learning, said student could still catch up and follow classes through online calls. It would be as if that student was right there alongside the rest of the class. Many schools in Asia have switched to online learning due to the Coronavirus outbreaks and high chance of being infected. Online classes are very convenient because these students are able to use the power of technology to continue their studies. It's also convenient for teachers as they do not have to stress about make up work or students needing to catch up. Sickness may be a one time thing; what if someone has a physical disability that makes it extremely difficult to travel to different places? Online classes are extremely convenient for a person with disabilities because not only do they not have to worry about traveling, they can learn from the comfort of a familiar place like their own home."
"Comfort plays a big role on determining how well a person does. It is common knowledge that people perform better in a familiar, comfortable work environments than one that is uncomfortable. When discomfort is taken out of daily routines, the energy used to combat discomfort would instead be used to focus on something else. For example, my mother cannot sleep soundly anywhere that is not her own bed the first night because she isn't used to the bed yet. This leads to not enough sleep. However, if it was her own bed, she wouldn't have had to worry about discomfort and instead the energy that would've been used for feeling uncomfortable would be used to sleep well. Similarly, the comforts of a student's home and pajamas will yield better grades because the energy they would've used to get used to a different setting and time used to put together an outfit would be used to pay attention in class and understand new class material."
"Online schooling is a safer alternative to going to school. It is safer for the environment and for students. Schools are trying to go paperless to help the environment but if school itself is online, not only is paper being saved, but pollution will decrease due to the lack of school buses, cars, and other means of transportation. With the doom of climate change approaching, anything should be done to at least postpone it, online classes are one way of doing so. Benefiting the environment indirectly benefits students, but a way that online classes are directly beneficial is violence in schools would decrease. With everyone safe at home, bomb threats, school shootings, and other forms of violence would decrease, if not disappear, entirely. The extermination of school-related violence would make students more eager to learn because they do not have to keep their guard up at all times; once again, using that energy to good use: studying."
"Online schooling is an incredible way to utilize technological advancements to good use. The convenience of technology is unbeatable and making school online would make everyone's life easier. Comfort plays a major role in making staying at home and learning convenient. Online schooling is especially beneficial because it is so much safer. Though there will always be benefits to in-building schooling, school through online calls and conferences will always be superior and beneficial to students due to its convenience, comfort, and safety. "
"Are you thinking about going the Seagoing Cowboys? If you are, I got plenty of reasons why you should and also what you do in this program. Think to yourself what would you do in Seagoing Cowboys."
I think that you should join the
Seagoing Cowboys because it will allow you to experience and visit many unique places.
When you are on board the ship you can find many things to do and many games to play. Sometimes after the animals were unloaded they would play baseball and volleyball. In
On the ship there are many things Tod o. Some people have to take night watch to stay up and watch the animals. During the day you have to feed and water the animals three times. If someone on that boat didn't then those animals would be useless.
"Luke was a Seagoing Cowboy, and he did a lo OG these things I said. Luke took night watch to watch the animals, that night after returning his report in the fell down stair towards an opening of the ocean, but he caught himself. Luke broke ribs, so he could not work for a while. Also, when he broke his ribs he found to have fun on the boat and off the boat. They could play games in the animals' pen when they got unloaded. Like I said they could play games like Volleyball and Baseball."
"Being a Seagoing Cowboy need s confidence and strength, you could get picked to do any job but you don't know what it is. When you're on the boat it is too late to go back because you are in the middle of the sea."
Joining the Seagoing Cowboys is an opportunity to have fun make friends and explore. You can also go see new counties and got o unique places.
Some people can take that to heart.
Sometimes going to a different country is like seeing something that you loved the most that you haunt seen in a while. That place you visit could be where your family originated from. Joining the Seagoing
"Cowboys would be an amazing thin to do. Yes you would HAE your ups and downs, but you can always get back up. Just think if you join the Seagoing Cowboys you can do a lot of the things that you thought you could not do. That would be amazing. If I got the opportunity to be a Seagoing Cowboy I would say yes because I like to push my limits. "
"Cell phones were first presented in the US in the time of 1980 and their utilization right away developed during the following two decades. One of the essential explanations behind the enormous development of phones is that they encourage correspondence offering an increasing amount of adaptability contacting wanted individuals inside seconds. Everyday people die in car accidents because they use cell phones while driving. Although some people support using cell phones while driving, there are evidences that they are dangerous and people should avoid talking while driving. Different drivers out and about consider drivers on their mobile phones whether they need to or not in light of the dangers they make. Mobile phones allow users to reach others during crisis notwithstanding during driving, in spite of a viable method for correspondence, utilizing cell phones during driving outcomes in diverting consideration of driver increasing road safety concerns."
"To begin with, we have turned out to be so centered around the amount we can do at one time that we are eager to chance our own security just as the wellbeing of others since we can't put down our cell phones. Studies found that a cell phone put drivers at a four times more serious danger of an accident. When driving, once in a while it is hard to concentrate out and about which makes it simple to overlook that the streets are shared by everybody and not for your use. A young lady slaughtered a walker on a bike while she was messaging on her telephone. She might not have proposed to take such an individual's life, however she settled on the poor choice to drive and text which she needs to live with for the rest of her life. Any of us could have been that poor individual on that portentous day. Regardless of the dangers, individuals still use cell phones since they need to be constantly accessible and stay in contact with other individuals. Scott Clark, veteran web business strategist and the owner of the consultancy BuzzMaven Labs, says ""He came within inches of a bad accident because of a young driver being on the phone and crossing three lanes of traffic at 45 mph."" Drivers are also tailgating you because of, again, the inability to maintain a constant speed because they are on the phone. Clark warns of"" ... the rusty red Camaro tailgating the minivan full of kids."" Drivers who use cell phones while driving are also highly dangerous to pedestrians."
"On the other hand, those whose work relies upon a mobile phone like legal advisors or agents state that they generally must be accessible to pick up the telephone to keep their business running. Be that as it may, due to their propensities, they can make risky and unsafe circumstances like an impact or a mishap. Business issues can be upsetting and perilous while driving since it can cause enthusiastic responses that can prompt disaster. As a result of the discussion they may get furious and this can bring down their driving capacity that can prompt lose power over the vehicle. If Individuals don't settle on a choice to secure their mobile phones their routine can hurt honest individuals. Rivals state that without hands set is security since individuals can drive utilizing two hands. Nonetheless, without hands gadgets don't wipe out the danger of causing a mishap and even may it intensify by recommending that the conduct is sheltered. Inquires about demonstrate that utilizing headset can be as risky as holding a telephone on the grounds that the discussions diverts drivers from concentrating out and about. Researchers had demonstrated that individuals talking via telephone picture individual who they're conversing with and that doesn't meddle with driving. The issue is the point at which a vehicle swerves startlingly or person on foot venture into traffic, and the mind comes up short on the handling capacity to respond in time. So the issue isn't in holding the haggle telephone in the meantime what may cause a mishap in view of need man oeuvre, it is a result of discussion and absence of response at the especially time."
"In conclusion, if individuals don't surrender their cell phones, the quantity of fatalities on the streets will even now increment. It is individuals duty to not bring about their very own and others individuals lives. These days mobile phones are pointless gadgets since they are untrustworthy in crisis circumstances while On Star is dependably plan to help you in a mishap. Reckless driving is something that we as a whole get very worked up about, particularly on the off chance that it makes us late or is generally an immediate burden to us.  "
Dear principle.
I believe that we should go with policy 1 because. Students already use there cell phones anyway it's a waste of time to try and stop them. There just going to do it anyway. The world is evolving daily everything is changing almost all the students have a phone let them use it during lunch and free time.
"And there is also a good use of the cell phones. Teachers can use it to send work to the students through text messages and the students can send there answers back. Also, the students can help other students with there work by talking to them through texts. It will also be easier to remind students of upcoming tests and remind them to study."
"But there are some disadvantages to having cell phones in school. One is that students could lose our get there cell phones stolen, and then the office would be blown up by angry parents. Two students would not watch wear they are going and could fall our run into someone and then the school could be sued. Three the students wouldn't get all of their nutrients from lunch because they would be texting all of there lunch period, and then they would think about food instead of listening to the teacher."
And as I said earlier there are advantages and disadvantages to having cell phones in school. But we need to use them at the right time and not abuse the privilege of using them.
"I personally think that completely driveless cars are a bad idea. As a 16-year-old, I'm finally the legal age to receive my licenses, but I can't receive my licenses if I don't have a car to drive. With driveless cars, we are literally allowing cars to think for us."
"If driveless cars do become the new thing to have, what would the driver do? The driver would simply stop paying attention to the road, and the car would do everything for them. With the car doing everything for them, more drivers would focus their energy and attention somewhere else, causing more accidents. With more accidents, who would be at fault? Would it be the driver, or the company?"
"How will the laws be made in order to keep others safe if the car happens to break down? With actually drivers driving a car their attention, and energy is on the road they're driving on. If they do cause an accident, there are cars that are made to prevent an accident before it happens."
"Being able to drive a car is a privilege, and with driveless cars, we're taking that privilege away for others who have waited so long to be able to drive.  "
"The author supports his or her idea that studying Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the danger it presents by explaining why Venus should be studied, the reasons why studying Venus is difficult, and the solutions to the problems caused by the climate of Venus."
"The author supports his or her idea by stating the reasons why Venus should be explored. The author states in paragraph 4, ""Furthermore, recall that Venus can sometimes be our nearest option for a planetary visit, a crucial consideration given the long time frames of space travel."" The reason stated supports the authors' idea because without a reason to study Venus there would likely be very little reason to justify studying Venus without a proper incentive."
"The author further supports his or her idea by explaining why studying Venus would be so difficult. The author explains in paragraph 3, ""A thick atmosphere of almost 97 percent carbon dioxide blankets Venus. Even more challenging are the clouds of highly corrosive sulfuric acid in Venus's atmosphere."" If there were no explanation on why it would be difficult to study Venus there would be no way for scientists to figure out solutions to the various problems of studying Venus."
"The author then goes on to explain possible solutions for the obstacles of studying Venus. The author states in paragraph 7, ""Another project is looking back to an old technology called mechanical computers."" The author also states in paragraph 7, ""...some simplified electronics made of silicon carbide have been tested in a chamber simulating the chaos of Venus's surface and have lasted for three weeks in such conditions."" By explaining possible solutions the author proves that there is hope in studying and that attempting to study Venus isn't a futile effort."
"The author supports his or her idea to study Venus by explaining why Venus should be studied, why it is so difficult to study Venus, and by explaining possible solutions to studying Venus. If there were no reason to study Venus then Venus wouldn't even be attempted study. Without an explanation of the problems of studying Venus there would be no form of figuring out a solution. With the help of possible solutions, more effective solutions can be found in the future."
3. explaining the reasons WY it's hard to explore
"This technology to read the emotions and expressions of students in the classroom would be very helpful. Most of the time humans can't tell what a person is feeling and how they will act. With this new technology it could figure out how your emotions are, and it could help out the teachers in a classroom to teach a lesson differently based on how some students are expressing their emotions. A person cant read muscles inside a persons face, only a computer can do that and that is what is so amazing about this new technology is that it can do stuff that a person can not do."
"This technology could help teachers in the classroom or coaches working on film or a business, to see how all of their workers or their students are reacting to all that is being thrown at them. This benefits the teachers mostly because society has changed so much and a lot of stuff is done on computers, and they teach a lot of lessons off of computers and in the text it says"" A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored."" This means that whenever a student is sitting there learning the lesson and something comes up, and they are very confused they may make a face of confusion and the computer will read that face and the teacher could know how the students felt about the lesson based on the results that the computer came up with when the students were learning the lesson. From there she could help certain students figure something out or teach them an alternative way because now she knows that some kids don't get the material. With this new technology she is able to figure out who is getting the material and who is not and before, she could not figure out if a student was having trouble with the material or not because most of the time students don't speak up and say anything when they are confused because they feel like they are the only ones who are having trouble but with this technology they don't even have to say a word they can just express their emotions and the computer will pick it up. With this new technology it knows what a fake expression is and what is not a fake expression do to the muscles inside your face. In the bottom of paragraph seen it says ""They even indicate the difference between a genuine smile and a forced one."" This means that there is no faking out of the lesson, you either understand it or you don't and there is no slipping past it with this new technology."
In the end it makes it easier fora lot of people when considering that this technology can do things that people cannot do. It will make it easier on teachers and on the students because the computer is telling the teacher how the students react to the material that is being thrown at them. The students will feel the way they feel and there is no hiding that anymore with this new technology.  
"Dear state senator,"
I ask you to change the voting methods to popular vote instead of Electoral collage because the candidates for presidency give no importance to small states that do not have many electoral collage votes; focus more on those that have many Electoral collage votes and candidates for presidency don't need to be the most popular of all to win the presidency.
"Candidates don't really care for small states with small population because they know that they don't matter in the result of them being elected as president or not. According to ""The Indefensible Electoral Collage: Why even the best-laid defenses of the system are wrong"" by Bradford Plume ""Seventeen states didn't see the candidates all all, including Rhode Island and South Carolina, and voters in 25 of the largest media markets didn't get so see a single campaign as. ""You may ask yourself why they didn't see any of this well one thing that both of them share is that they don't have as many electoral collage votes as other states like California that has 55 electoral votes. And it's a winner take all the less popular candidate from the state doesn't get any votes at all."
"You don't have to be the most popular in the nation in order to win the presidency and it's a winner take all. According to the ""The Indefensible Electoral Collage: Why even the best-laid defense of the system are wrong"" by Bradford Plume ""Voters vote not for the president, but for a Slater of electors, who in turn elect the president."" For example when bush was running for president he was not the most popular in the nation and Gore was, in the end Bush was elected president for winning more the electoral votes then Gore. This is unfair for many people because more than half the nation didn't want Bush but yet he was elected without the popular vote."
"However, According to ""In Defense of the Electoral Collage: Five reasons to keep our despised methods of choosing the"
"President"" by Richard A. Poster there is less likely to be a dispute over the electoral collage votes then in a dispute over the popular vote. It also requires a presidential candidate to have trans-regional appeal. ""The electoral collage avoids the problem of elections in which no candidate receives a majority of the votes cast."
This is why I ask you state senator to change from Electoral Collage voting method to The Popular voting to elect The President of the United States Of America because the candidates for presidency give no importance to small states that do not have many electoral collage votes and care more for those that do plus the candidate doesn't have to be the most popular in the to win the elections to become the President of the U.S.A. 
"Working with a group is more beneficial or working alone is more beneficial? Working with a group is more beneficial. People can get help from another person, and they can be more successful by working together. Although some people think that working alone is more beneficial, working with a group is more successful because it would be easier to ask for help and to succeed in life."
"Some people think that working alone is more successful. It gives people time to plan and easier to make good efforts. Some people prefer to not work with a group because they might make bad efforts on other people's work. Overall people say that working by yourself is more beneficial, they are wrong because working with a group can help you be more successful."
Some people prefer to work with a group. It is more helpful to get help from another person. Some people had a hard time planning what they want to work on like homework or school project. Working with a group is more successful because it would be easier to get help from another person.
"Some people prefer to work with a group. People can be more successful by working together. Some people had a good idea, and they used that idea to make good efforts. Working with a group is more beneficial because they can use other people's idea to make good efforts for their work."
"Although some people prefer to work by themselves, a group work will help them be more successful. A group work helps other people to be more successful because one person had an idea and other people can use their idea to get their work completed. People can share their work to another person, so they can check if they made good efforts."
"I do not agree with the author in the article ""Making Mona Lisa Smile"" when he describes how a new technology called the Facial Action Coding System enables computers to identify human emotions works. The use of this technology is to read the emotional expressions of students in a classroom is not valuable to me. There are reasons why I don't agree, and I know that I'm not the only person who disagree with this argument."
"One reason is that schools shouldn't allow anyone to put that technology into their computers because that technology has nothing to do with school or what the kids are learning at school. Another reason is that the way people feel is how they feel, it's not meant for the whole world, the school, or anyone to know how they are feeling if they didn't tell that person. If that person didn't tell anyone that's because they wanted to keep what was wrong with them to their self."
"In paragraph three it says that the Facial Action Coding System that is enabled in computers can tell if a human is feeling happy, surprise, angry, disgust, fear, and sadness. If a student is feeling happy or surprise it's okay for people to know, but when a student is feeling angry, disgust, fear, and sad it's not because you don't know what that person is going through or how that person is living."
This technology that someone came up with is not a good idea. I said it's not because I wouldn't want anyone to know how I'm feeling if I'm not in a good mood. If I'm angry or sad about something I would keep it to myself and not tell anybody because I wouldn't people to see bringing it up to me when I'm trying to forget about it.
"Using Facial Action Coding System (FACS) to read students emotions could be a good thing. It could allow teachers, staff, and other students to know how a student is feeling. If you know they are feeling sad, you could change something to make them feel happy. These things could make the student more willing to learn and be more excited about school."
"If you were to recognize how someone was feeling, think about how much that could benefit you and the person feeling that way. If you were to notice a student feeling sad or lonely, you find out the problem and solve it. If a student was mad or upset, you could fix that too. This might create less violence in schools and higher school attendance rates. It could prevent fights and arguments between teachers and students. It could also prevent bullying. If a student is feeling sad, lonely, or depressed, teachers could recognize that and fix the problem before anything happened or got worse. This can also make school counselors better at their jobs and make their jobs easier. If counselor knew how you were feeling, they could get you the help you needed faster than when they had to figure out exactly how you were feeling."
"The Facial Action Coding System (FACS) can be a good thing. It could solve so many problems inside and outside of schools. It can show when you're happy, surprised, disgusted, afraid, sad, and angry. "
"Some schools implement a summer project to continue the flow of learning, and to ensure that the students' brains retain learned information. When asked to take a position on whether students or teachers should design these projects, I chose both sides. The reasoning behind my decision was quite simple: one side is more knowledgeable when it comes to the information, and has years of experience in teaching on their side. However, nobody knows the experience of living as the secondary group more than they themselves do, so it makes sense that they would have a part in this idea."
"Allow me to begin by playing devil's advocate against my own thinking. One may refute my statements with the simple argument of, ""Well, students don't know how to teach, so why should they have a part in this?"". One may also describe my thinking as ineffective by stating along the lines of, ""Well, nobody knows how to plan exciting experiences better than the ones who have to endure them"". Now, both these arguments are well rooted and difficult to counter, however that in and of itself is what lends them to my cause. The first argument supports the idea that teachers are more experienced, thus more prepared to enact such ideas and projects; the second argument then supports my secondary belief, that the students better know themselves, and can lend more than a simple helping hand in the creation of such activities."
"Now that I have finished counter-arguing and rebutting, I can begin my statements. I would like to begin with the teachers. My standing on the subject is that teachers are more experienced and better suited to plan the informational aspects of a summer's project. Why, if a student knew the subject well enough to plan such an activity, and knew how to best teach and explain it, then they would be in no need of a project or a teacher! Yes, it is the job of the teacher to... well, teach, and it is the job of the student to learn. However, this does not exclude the student from the planning process all together."
"The student is quite important, because they are the target audience. They will know, better than anyone, how to reach out and grab hold of their demographic. The student knows what is fun, boring, enticing, and annoying to them as a whole. While it is true that not all students are made equal, and what is fun to one may be dull to another, a democratic poll can be issued to help even the playing field. Alternatively, multiple projects can be issued out to different types of student, or a simple skeleton plan may be issued, with which the students may piece together their own project. Perhaps all three can be issued as a choice, with students choosing which ""flavor"" of project they would find easiest to follow. Yes, the student is an important piece to project design, with the teacher serving a bigger part in project management. Let the demographic choose their product."
"As I finish, allow me to restate my core ideas. The teacher is an important utility in the informational and managerial parts of a summer project; however, the student plays just as important a role in the design and creation aspects. Both sides are nearly equal in importance, and choosing just one as the end all be all is not dissimilar to how American politics are carried out. Yes, it is important to have a fair balance of both sides, with each person playing to their specific strengths. Too much equality and you have a democracy that will never move forwards. Too much freedom and you have a form of communism in which there is no order to help guide everyone to the correct paths. Yes, a balance is much needed; a balance, mind you, that will never be truly found."
"That doesn't mean we shouldn't try, however."
To the principal:
"Students should bring their cell phones to school and only use them during free periods and lunchtime because using phones is important; it's used for emergencies, calling other people that are in different places, and chatting with your friends from separate places. Cell phones are the important devices that are ever invented, and they are used to saving on trees. Back then, people had to write letters and send them to their friends, family, and businesses."
"Cell phones may cost a lot of money, but they're important to use, and you can call your parents from school if you are getting ill, and you want to use your own phone instead of the nurses' phone. Cell phones are like travel phones, you can keep them in your pocket when traveling and use them just in case you need them. I know that cell phones may be obnoxious to use during school since they have ringtones, but they are useful."
"Cell phones are the new telephones, because telephones are at-home phones, and you can't take them with you when you are traveling, and besides, telephones are getting old and people would want to have a device in their pocket while in public. Telephones might have more messages than a cell phone, because people are barely home, and they might have longer work shifts."
"When people are at work, they are wondering who's calling them on their telephones, and they might worry that they missed a call. People who are at work might be thinking about getting a cell phone instead of worrying about their telephone from home. We know that people don't like missing important calls, and they hate checking their messages. Telephones aren't made for texting like cell phones are."
"Students may also want to check appointments on their own when using their cell phone, so their parents won't have to remind them about scheduled appointments, and they can remind themselves on their own. Students may want to use a calculator in their free time while using their cell phone; cell phones also have a calculator program, so students won't have to bring in their own calculator when doing homework in free time, and they can just use the calculator on their cell phone."
It's FACTS That We Don't Need FACS
"Being in school brings out a mix of emotions in every student. Whether the student is stressed, happy, or sad depends on many variables. A student can feel these emotions because of a situation at home, a problem with a friend, and obviously because of the lessons or schoolwork going on in class. Can a machine truly and effectively monitor these emotions? Is a machine like this really needed in the current education system? It's not, The use of the Facial Action Coding System to read the emotional expressions of students in a classroom is not valuable."
"First, human emotions are complex. The article ""Making Mona Lisa Smile"" gave us several examples of muscles in the human face that were used when expressing emotion. A couple examples of these are the ""frontal is pars laterals,"" and the ""orbicularis Boris."" Although these muscles and the parts of the face they move are an important part of dictating emotion, that's not all there is understanding emotion. Body language is a massive part of emotion. The FACS may register a happy smile, but it won't see slouching shoulders. The text even states that, ""Each expression is compared against a neutral face (showing no emotion.)"" This means the FACS reads a blank expression as showing no emotion. What if someone with a person with a blank expression is conveying emotion through body language? Being a student and teenager, body language is a huge part of communication. With the FACS not being able to read body language, that's already a giant hole in its value."
"Next, how useful would this technology be outside an elementary school setting? The answer is absolutely not useful. In elementary school the teacher caters to each students' needs. They're able to do so because you have the same 20 to 30 kids every minute of every day for 180 schools days. But, in middle school and high school students have seven to eight different teachers throughout the day. Middle and high school teachers don't have the one on one time to cater to their students. As cold as it sounds, middle and high school teachers simply might not even care about their students feelings. At least not to the degree an elementary teacher would. Teachers in the upper levels have a strict set of standards that they need to teach. Students must then master those standards to pass the class. There isn't enough time for an upper level teacher to care about their students' emotions."
"Finally, students are kids. Kids experience a plethora of emotions throughout the day. Even though, ""The facial expressions for each emotion are universal,"" what would one use the information gathered from FACS for? Dr. Huang believes that, ""it [FACS] could modify the lesson, like an effective human instructor."" The fact that the text states that FACS is just as effective as a human teacher completely renders itself useless. If Dr. Hung, the software engineer of FACS, believes that this machine performs on an equal level to a human, there is absolutely no need for the FACS. As previously mentioned, upper level teachers do not have the time to modify their lesson plans due to their students emotions. That fact alone removes the need for the FACS."
"In conclusion, the use of FACS is not valuable to read the emotional expressions of students in a classroom. The FACS does not have a place in the current education system. With evidence from the article ""Making Mona Lisa Smile"" it is clear that the FACS is only on the same level of reading emotions as, ""an effective teacher."" This renders the FACS not only as useless to students in a classroom, but also as a likely massively more expensive alternative to human teachers.  "
"Some schools offer distance learning as an option for students to attend classes from home by way of online or video conferencing. Students learn by different ways now especially with advances to technology. Many find learning from home appropriate and the best option for their leaning experience. The opposition wrongly believes students will not benefit from being able to attend classes from home because of learning disabilities and also if a student has possible questions that need to be answered. Although some believe students will not benefit from being able to attend classes from home, it should be known students will benefit from being able to attend classes from home."
"Students who attend classes from home are able to stay on task due to internal skills. One internal skill a student achieves from working at home is being more productive. To be productive means simply staying on task to get work done faster. An example of being productive is a student while attending school at home is given multiple assignments. However, the student exemplifies a sense of purpose and works to their fullest potential to get the work done in an orderly fashion. Next, students who attend classes from home are able to obtain time management. Time management means being able to work while using the time a person is given wisely. For example, a student might take classes at home but has to also make time for house cleaning, and their job. However, the individual creates a schedule to make sure they have time to do all of these tasks in a timely fashion. This shows that a student can gain time management skills because they are able to get basic housework done and at the same time prioritize school work. Finally, students who attend classes from home are able to obtain responsibility. Being responsible means doing the assigned work without being told to do it. For instance, a student who is assigned work does the work without being reminded by teacher or professor. This shows responsibility because some students realize that online school is an advantage that should not be taken for granted."
"Students who attend classes from home are able to stay on task due to external benefits. One external benefit a student has from working home is fewer distractions. Distractions are people, animals, or things that limits and individuals way of staying focus. For example, students who take classes at home some might live by themselves. However, in some cases a quiet environment allows a student to focus and understand what they are learning. This allows them to get work done faster because at school there are multiple distractions around a person so It's easy to get off task. Next, students who take classes at home benefit because it can potentially increase their grades. This means grades in a particular class would rise. For instance, a student might have a problem taking classes in school because they can not get decent grades. Therefore, they take classes at home which motivates them and because of that they have a different attitude, and they start applying themselves. Which is the turning point for them increasing their grades. Finally, students benefit from taking classes at home because they are able to work ahead of everyone. Working ahead means doing required work ahead of time before it is due. For example, a student doing grad point might take extra classes at home to get more credits. In doing these students are able to take classes ahead of others and once they get their required amount of credits they can possibly graduate early."
"Even though some believe students will not benefit from being able to attend classes from home, it should be known students will benefit from being able to attend classes from home. Opponents incorrectly think, students will not benefit from being able to attend classes from home because of just pure laziness and a lack of motivation a person has. However, students will benefit from being able to attend classes from home due to internal skills a student will achieve like productivity, time management, and responsibility. Additionally, students will benefit from being able to attend classes from home due to external benefits like a chance at higher grades, fewer distractions, and being able to work ahead. Students should understand taking classes from home can argue as one of the greatest advances in today's society. Being able to work at home allows students to build skills needed for future careers and learn proper work ethic needed for certain jobs. Individuals should not take opportunities like this for granted and should work to their fullest potential if given this great opportunity."
"Driverless cars are a thing of the future. They would be very useful especially if they use less fuel than normal taxis, but in situations where there is dangerous road conditions, like snowing flooding, and high winds, how will the car react?"
"With the weather always changing will the driverless car be able to keep up, or will everybody just have to stop what they're doing? The weather influences driving greatly. You have to be able to drive in any condition, that's why driverless car aren't ready. If the driverless car needs someone to take over when there's road work and accidents, the same thing would happen in dangerous driving conditions. The car could not tell that there is ice on the roads. Sometimes cars hydroplane, the smart car would not be able to right the car but, just spin out and take the impact and put lives in danger. This would increase accidents or even deaths. These cars aren't safe to drive in conditions like these. The smart car isn't smart enough to be driving in different types of weather or situations."
"The car can't adapt to driving conditions, so would it be able to avoid things like potholes and animals that run out in front of cars? Potholes occur everywhere, if one of these driverless cars hits one a blows a tire the passenger could be stranded. The car couldn't have done anything to avoid the pothole, so it's not to safe. Then there are animals that jump out in front of cars last second or even people. The road is always changing and things are always happening, i don't believe the driverless car will be able to function in certain situations. Sensors can only sense so much that certain times if there is no person in the driver seat things can go wrong."
"There are times in traffic that traffic lights go out and people have to make decisions. The car can not think to stop at a flashing ready light and then yield to oncoming cars. There are situations there a person is the best option. Unless the car can think for itself. The driverless car is too unpredictable and can put peoples lives in danger. Accidents occur all the time, I don't believe a driverless car can avoid an ongoing accident. Then there are situations with police, or stolen cars. Would the car give away its owner if they were on the run from the police? How would traffic stops work, would the car be so perfect to not break the law? The car could be harboring fugitives or runways or even kidnapped victims. The car wouldn't be smart enough to know, It's going to do what its told and drive."
"I don't believe that self-driving cars are ready for today's society nor will they ever be. The road is always changing, and the car would not be able to keep up."
"I'm going to tell you why you should join or why you shouldn't join the program. I'll be giving my reason and also Luke's reasons to support my claim. Furthermore, I will be arguing on why others should join the program."
"Others should join the program because you get to travel around the world. Luke stated that he went to China and Europe! He traveled the Pacific and Atlantis ocean several times. He's been to Greece. If you like to travel, this would be a great program to join."
"Luke feeds and waters the animals. Luke has to check on the animals every hour. I would join this program because I'm an animal person and I would love to spend weeks, maybe even months with these animals. Others who aren't animal people maybe shouldn't join this program. It would be a great way to interact with the animals if you don't like animals all that much."
"Joining this program could teach you something. It could teach you many things. It could teach you to be more cautious about things. As Luke stated ""It made me more aware of people of other countries and their needs."" This program can make you more grateful for everything. It could make you work harder instead of being lazy. You could actually get things done if you were to join this program. That is why I think you should join.  "
"In many places around the world people own cars and drive around almost every day. But what many people don't know is that cars can release harmful gases that can hurt the earth's environments. Three reasons why limiting car usage in your community is good is because it prevents traffic, it helps the environment and your community, and we don't really need cars to live our everyday lives."
"Limiting car usage in your community is good because it prevents traffic. Every day, people use their cars to go places even if the place their going to is down the street and that causes traffic sometimes. For example, in Paris there has been days of near-record pollutions due to traffic, so Paris enforced a partial driving ban to clear the air from pollution. They said every Monday motorist with even-numbered license plate were ordered to leave their cars at home or face a 22 euro fine. This ban helped because congestion dropped 60 percent in the capital of France just after five days of the ban was set."
"Another reason why limiting car usage in your community is good is because it helps prevent pollution to the surrounding air. Cars can release gasses that can harm the earths environment and the surrounding community. Which is why in the United States the Environmental Protection Agency is promoting ""car reduced"" communities much like the one in Vauban, Germany. These ""car Free"" communities consist of a small town where the usage of cars is illegal, you are not even allowed to own homes with a large in it. This is very good for the environment and can prevent air pollution."
"We should limit how often we use cars because we don't really need them to get around and many countries believe so too. For example in Bogotá, Colombia there is a program that was set to spread out to other countries, during this program millions of Colombians hiked, biked, skated or took buses to work. One reason why these people might have done this is because anyone who violated this rule would have been fined $25, but the main goal for this was to prevent smog in their countries' environment. The turn-out however was huge! Even when there was rain it didn't stop them. The mayor of Bogotá said ""The rain hasn't stopped people from participating"" and now for the first time two other Colombian cities, Cali and Valledupar joined the event."
"There are many reasons why we should limit the usage of cars in our communities because it prevents traffic, helps the environment and because we don't really need to use cars so often, take Colombia for example. So let's take action and follow the steps that many countries and communities are taking to help our communities."
"""All of our development since World War II has been centered around the car, and that will have to change,"" said David Goldberg, an official of Transportation for America. David Goldberg says this in means of trying to decrease car usage, such as in Vauban, Germany. Car usage after World War II continued increasing for a long period of time until 2005 in the United States the number of miles driven started to decrease. In the year 2013, the miles driven in the United States decreased nearly 9% since 2005 and was equal to the amount of miles driven in 1995. Throughout the whole world people have been experiencing problems with air pollution and due to that many have been trying to decrease the usage of cars in different ways to slow this air pollution."
"To start off, pollution from cars has been a large factor of the air pollution today. In the United States, 50 percent of the greenhouse emissions in the United States is caused by passenger cars. Then there is Paris who has been experiencing heavy smog. Recently, it has had days of near-record pollution. Reason for such high levels of smog or air pollution can be attributed to a tax policy that favors diesel over gasoline. Diesel makes up 67% of vehicles in France. Then in the rest of Western Europe 53.3% of the vehicles are diesel."
"Next, is how some people attempt to slow the car pollution. The first example of a community trying to decrease the usage of cars is Vauban, Germany. In Vauban street parking, driveways, and home garages are generally forbidden. For the most part, Vauban is car free. The only way to use cars in Vauban is to carpool because there is only two places to park in the whole city, and they are two large parking garages on the edge of development. Then you have to pay $40,000 to keep a spot. 70% of the people in Vauban do not own cars. Another example is Paris, who is one of the biggest air pollutants next to Beijing. They have been trying to decrease the smog in their area through slowing the amount of cars on the road. What they did is make it so only cars with even-numbered license plates could drive one day and odd-numbered license plates the next. Almost 4,000 drivers were fined due to this policy, which showed some reluctance in following the plan. This did not matter though because the smog cleared enough to where the policy only lasted for one day. Another attempt in lowering the usage of cars was Bogotá's car-free day. In this program it is quite obvious that it was just a day of no car usage at all. During this event Colombians hiked, biked, skated or took buses to work. Even in the rain people of Bogotá participated in this event. Then there is one other case of lowering the usage of cars, which is the natural way, having people just grow away from the car. This is currently happening in the United States, one of if not the largest car users. Like I said earlier since 2005 the usage of cars has decreased. Whether this trend stays in motion or not depends on the idealism of the current and future generations."
"To conclude, the use of cars is creating problems in air pollution and due to this there have been attempt to slow this usage. Then back to what David Goldberg said the development of the car needs to stop being the center of attention. So instead what we have to do is take our attention away from using the car to ways of finding ways to limit the cars use.  "
"In the passage, The Challenge of Exploring Venus, there is a passage explaining what Venus looks while they send machines to discover the planet. The author tries to explain to us what kind of challenges they have found while exploring Venus. The point of view that the author see is that Venus is a worthy pursuit despising the dangers on it. Each passage has its own main part about Venus, however, it will talk about the challenge that are face in Venus"
"In these parts of the article the author has the idea that studying Venus is a worthy pursuit despising the dangers, and he explains his reasoning with the context that is left behind this article. The passage tells us about why it's worthy to pursuit it, in passage 8 it says, ""striving to meet the challenge presented by Venus has value, not only because of the insight to be gained on the planet itself, but also because human curiosity will likely lead us into many equally intimidating endeavors."" The meaning of this part of the passage is telling us how people just think about how or what it is like to explore Venus. NASA has been trying to make inventions to help them go to Venus and have a closer look."" NASA is working on other approaches to study Venus."""
"Although people want to go and explore Venus, there are some challenges that Venus provides for people. The dangers in this article tells us in passage 1"" While Venus is simple to see from the distant but safe vantage point of Earth, it has proved a very challenging place to examine more closely."" It's hard for us to explore something from far away but during the attempts we still can get close to Venus. In the passage it says, ""A lot of spacecraft haven't survived the landing in a few hours. Maybe this issue explains why not a single spaceship has touched down on Venus in more than three decades."" These are some reason why we can not reach Venus as worthy it is, it is challenging to explore."
"The author does not care what kind of dangers there is because he thinks Venus is a planet that is worth to study. As he tries to get a closer look at. NASA has been also trying to help make machines and new inventions that are safe for people to go up and for themselves. Although the challenges that they have read, seen, or have heard kept stopping them from figuring out how to get closer to Venus. However, they did not give up because they kept looking for other ways to explore Venus. "
Have you ever seen an unmasking face ?well if you haven't let me tell you more about it.
"So there is the mask that in Mars. We are now trying to discover what this strange thing is. From what I am seeing. Its seems that this face is an unusual face that no one have seen before. As far as the scientists figured it was just another Martian Mesa, Common enough around Colonia."
"A few days later. NASA unveiled the image for all to see. The caption noted a ""huge rock formation. . . Which resembles a human Head. . . Formed by shadows giving the illusion of eyes, noes, and mouth"" The Authors reasoned it would be a good way to engage the public and attract to Mars."
"The"" Face on Mars"" has since become a pop icon. It has started in Hollywood film, appeared in books, magazines, radio talk shows--even haunted grocery store checkout lines for 25 years! Some people think the face is bona fide evidence of life on mars---evidence that NASA would rather hide, say conspiracy theorists. Meanwhile, defenders of the NASA budget wish there was an ancient civilization on Mars."
"So on April 5, 1998, When Mars Global Surveyor flew over Colonia for the first time, Michael Main and his Mars Orbiter Camera (MOC) team snapped a picture ten times Sharper than the original Viking photos. Thousands of anxious web surfers were waiting when the image first appeared on JPL website, revealing. . . A natural landform. There was no alien monument after all."
"So they all came together and thought about it. So there Now exchanging it all right. There trying to say that the picture from NAS is not the right picture which is so true. There trying to still the picture from somebody else which there trying to take the credit from Mars which found the picture and put it all together. So now there all confused on which just happen when Mars was just stating the simple facts that they found the picture and knows where the of=the one is and their going to put it back together, so they can have the right picture only if. NASA don try to come over well them with a different picture which is going to throw them off-topic and confuse then on which to do and what not to do because they came with the wrong information and Mars had all the right information to which to out and how to put it all together and complete the big puzzle everybody been trying to out together because all alone they had it from the being but was not sure it Weiss right nor positive and sure about that picture so when the NASA came to Mars and try to prove them wrong on a other level they out stood them, and made them think over so now NASA about to go back and try to discover the their pieces to the puzzle when its already solved they don't understand that they already have the puzzle figured out all along but now there trying to take what Mars had and say they found it first but not only that. But they have found something else which identify that that puzzle have been put together before the NASA found it. But its seems to me that the reader that MARS has found the puzzle face and put it together and now NASA is on investigation once Again."
"The cell phones are nice device because you could all over the country for example Florida to China that amazing, but letting kids used their phones at school is not properly because they be texting and sending nasty message to each other is not right for them and one main reason would be not paying attention to the Teacher and the teacher would be mad at them, she would give everyone a detention."
Teacher would not like to be teaching for nothing because they are not going to pay attention and just talk with their friends and the teacher would be mad at them that she is going to tell at the principal about the phones that they need to be taken away from them.
The next thing you know the principal would tell every parent of a kid to take away their phones and keep it home until they arrived home they would be used and would be a good idea for the school grade.
In conclusion do not allow students to have phones at school at all first the teacher would get mad and take away their phones another reason is they would send bad message to each other and might be a big deal because it may say something that hurt their feelings therefore I suggest that do not allow kid to used cell phones.
"In the article ""Making Mona Lisa Smile,"" the author introduces a new form of technology, the Facial Action Coding System. The new technology allows computers to identify human emotions. The use of this technology will not be valuable to students in a classroom because it will be expensive, communication skills will be lost, and technology is not always accurate."
"As it is now, without this new technology, some schools barely have enough money to buy basic supplies needed to provide a proper education for the students. If the Facial Action Coding System (FACS) is added in the classrooms it will be another expense that is not necessary. In the passage it says, ""Your home PC cant handle the complex algorithms used to decode Mona Lists smile."" This statement implies that, in order to use FACS, the school will have to buy not only the software, but also new computers that will support the system. That is a lot of money spent on unnecessary items when it could be spent on the basic supplies that most schools can barely provide now."
"In today's world communication skills are bad enough already, with the current technology that students are surrounded by each day. In the passage it states, ""'A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored,' Dr. Huang predicts. 'Then it could modify the lesson, like an effective human instructor.'"" If the new technology is added into the classroom and, to a point, taking the place of a teacher, communication skills will be further taken away. Teachers teach more than just science, math, or English to the students. Having a teacher in the classroom also teaches students how to communicate properly with adults and how to carry on mature conversations. Taking away that human interaction will have a negative effect on the students."
"Technology is not always accurate. If this software makes an appearance in classrooms and students start using it, it could give false information. The passage states, ""By weighting the different units, the software can even identify mixed emotions (as in the Vinci masterpiece). Each expression is compared against a neutral face (showing no emotion)."" Each person's face is compared to the exact same neutral face, which will not be accurate. Each person has a different neutral face, so in order for the information to be correct, it will need to be compared against each person's neutral face."
"There are multiple reasons that the new software will not be beneficial to students in the classroom, however, there are a couple of reasons that the technology will be valuable. In the passage it says, ""A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored,  Dr. Huang predicts."" The computers telling the teacher that the student is confused could be beneficial because most students will not tell the teacher if they are confused, which causes them to get bad grades if they do not understand the material. If the teacher knows that the student is confused, they can take actions to make sure that they help them understand. Later in the passage it says, ""Empathy (feeling someone else emotional state) may happen because we unconsciously imitate another persons facial expressions."" The new technology could help students understand and have empathy, which will be a good thing. Lots of people do not have a lot of empathy in today's world, which is part of the reason why the world is a very cold place. Students having empathy could result in everyone treating each other better, if they can try to understand the things that their peers are feeling."
"Overall, FACS will cause people more trouble and headaches than anything. After considering both sides of the argument, it is safe to say that the new technology will not be beneficial to students in the classroom because of the combination of it being expensive, taking away communication skills, and not always being accurate."
"Why only seek one opinion when you can get multiple? People often go to more than one person for advice when they need an opinion. If you only seek advice from one person you might not be very confident in your choice. The more people you get advice from, the better choice you can make."
"Although one person's opinion might feel like enough, it's better to get many. One person might have a slightly bias opinion on a situation. They also might give advice they end up helping themselves more than you. When you get more opinions it is a less likely chance that all the opinions will be bias."
Getting more than one piece of advice could also help you feel more confident when making a decision.
If you only get one person's advice then you likely will not feel very confident while making the decision and might not be happy with your decision later. If you get multiple opinions you can feel confident in your decision and not dread about how it might be a bad decision. Being confident in your decision will make you feel like you made the right choice.
"Even if you get one bad opinion you do not agree with or think is a bad idea, it can help you see what choice you actually want and should make. When getting opinions you might be able to realize what you actually want and what would be the best decision. If you receive certain advice but do not like it, the opinion was still helpful to you because you can be more sure that you don't like that opinion, and you like other opinions better. All together bad opinions also help with making good choices."
"The more advice you receive the better choice you will end up making. More opinions will always help you feel more confident in your decision. Always seek more than one person for advice even if it's not a major decision. Remember than all advice, whether good or bad, help you make the right decision."
"Should summer projects be teacher-designed or student-designed? Quite a few schools require students to complete summer projects, so they can continue learning even during their breaks. Many people have different opinions on whether it should be teacher-designed or student-designed. Personally, a summer project that is designed by a teacher would be helpful. I believe the summer project should be teacher-designed since it's more difficult and provides better resources."
"If the students' summer projects were to be designed by teachers, the difficulty would definitely increase. It may sound like a bad thing for students, but it would help them gain more knowledge; specifically on the topics the students had received for their project. The harder the project is, the more knowledge you gain. Students should challenge themselves with harder projects in order to sharpen their mind more. The difficulty level will surely help everyone prepare for future works and projects. An academic challenge is needed whether one wants it or not. A student-designed summer project wouldn't exactly be helpful in that case."
"Teacher-designed summer projects seemingly provides better resources for students since it's more advanced. The projects would surely have better quality and higher difficulty. If it were to be student-designed, it wouldn't be as advanced as the teacher-designed project. The better the resources are, the more information you get. Teachers do put their heart and time into using resources in order to make a great project for students' to improve their skills and help them learn more. Personally, it's always great to have a teacher-designed work since it's a huge help to tons of people. They would provide better resources than student-designed after all."
"Others may counter back that the student-designed summer projects would be better since it would be easier on students and will still help them learn more. The counter back statement brings out a good valid point, however, it wouldn't be a challenge for students. Projects that are student-designed would still help, but not as much as teacher-designed ones. I believe many students would agree that teachers creates harder work and projects. The difficulty may be high, but it would definitely help the student learn more through hard work. Harder work means more information and knowledge. If the summer projects were to be easier, students would complete it fast and might not learn much from it. Therefore, the summer projects should be teacher-designed."
"The stated question on whether summer projects should be teacher-designed or student-designed has a clear answer by now. The answer being that the projects are better off as teacher-designed. Schools should have teacher-designed projects since they are more difficult and provides better resources which are helpful in getting students to learn more and better. Students surely would be upset that the projects are not easier since it would make them struggle. Easier projects sound nice, but they aren't as useful as harder projects. I believe one gains more knowledge and skills from a tough challenge. It will highly prove to become helpful in the future. In conclusion, summer projects designed by teachers are the better option. "
"To whom this may concern,"
"The ""winner takes all"" system we've been using doesn't work. Less power is essentially being given to the people, and, some are even being ignored."
"In cases such as Al Gore's, the people said yes, and the College said no. And, voters didn't like this. According to a Gallup poll in 2000, after Al Gore lost the race, ""over 60% of voters would prefer a direct election to the kind we have now"", meaning, Mr. Senator, it's time for change. In addition, this system easily allows for a tie. In this event, the results of the race would be decided by the House of Representatives, which we all knows would swiftly put in a vote for the Republican candidate. And, since the Senate has also been recently dominated by Republicans, they too would choose one of their own, resulting in two branches of the government dominated by one political party."
"Moreover, with this faulty system, many people are being ignored. As you may recall (or not), ""During the 2000 campaign, seventeen states didn't see the candidates at all, including Rhode Island and South Carolina, and voters in 25 of the largest media markets didn't get to see a single campaign ad.""(Source 2, Paragraph 13) [(Although not seeing the ads might not have been a bad thing. (I'm just kidding.)] Why is this important? Because the people need to see and meet their candidates, but due to the electoral collage, people are being ignored. If the majority of the votes are known to be going to one candidate or the other, they will most likely not be visited by either side, because whom that state's electoral votes are going to are essentially locked in. The only states that receive any attention are the ""Swing states"" (Source 2, Paragraph 13) that are pretty equal on both sides and can be easily swayed to pick one candidate or the other."
"The only evidence to refute my claim would be that ""Maine and Nebraska each have a variation of proportional representation"" (Source 1, Paragraph 7), which actually might work; however, this would require all the states to change their policies, which we all know won't happen very easily."
"So, in summary, Mr. Senator, the way things work is going to need to change, we are being ignored and elections are being thrown. If you don't help us change this, the power of electing the president is going to remain with our, faulty, college."

"Can you imagine living in a place where there is no driving?  It is an amazing thing to think if every person doesn't drive in one big city that it saves so much pollution going in to the air.  Another thing to think about is if everyone in a city didn't drive and walked everywhere, more people would stay healthier by staying in shape.  Some people think that owning a car is more stressful than just walking everywhere.  If you don't own a car you don't have to pay for insurance, don't have to pay for gas, and don't have to pay for repairs when something goes wrong in a vehicle.  To me, it sounds like there is a lot of advantages in limiting car use."
"One solid reason why not using cars as much is the pollution going in the air.  In Paris, France motorists with even numbered license plates were ordered to leave their cars at their house or else they would be fined.  The next day odd numbered license plates motorists had to leave their vehicles at home.  It was a hardship at first to get people to follow these new rules, but after about five days everything started to cool down.  The pollution had dropped 60 percent in Paris which is exactly what the city was looking for.  Limiting the car usage didn't just save pollution from going in the air, but also there wasn't as much traffic as there usually was.  It also made Paris a safer place to be outside and not damage the citizens lungs.  The capital city of France also made transportation free Monday-Friday to help the cause.  Soon enough people that had both license plates could drive on the same day."
"In Bogotá, Colombia they do a car free day that is becoming popular in that part of the world.  It is awesome to think there are 7 million people in that city and none of them are using a car.  People that violated this goal on this day were charged a $25 fine.  People from other countries came to see how this day worked, and they loved it.  The mayor of Asunción, Paraguay said ""These people are generating a revolutionary change, and this is crossing borders.""  You can just imagine all the benefits of everyone not using a car in a city for a whole day.  Restaurants and parks would be visited and used more and everyone would be getting more exercise.  All in all this idea was genius."
"As you can see limiting car usage can help out the area big time that it is taking place.  It is better breathing air, businesses like restaurants and parks would be used more and grow steadily, and the city would be taken care of better.  "
Hi my name is Luck Merger and as you may know I have crossed the Atlantic Ocean 16 time. Why? You might ask because I wanted to help people recover from War World ll. And I could also trade the world.
"While helping so many people I was able to see Europe and China. While in Italy I took a ride in a Venice, Italy a city with streets of water. It was amazing not only did I see amazing places, but I was able to work with a lot of amazing animals."
It took to weeks to cross the Atlantic Ocean for the east coast of the United States and a mouth to get to China. But carry for the animals took a lot of work. I had to feed them and clean up there mess. But working in my Aunt Katie's farm when I was younger helped me a lot.
We also had a lot of fun off the boat to. When we let the animals of the ship we would us the empty holds to play games like Volleyball and Baseball. But I have also got hurt in the ship where I have broken my rips.
"So in conclusion, there were good times and bad times while on board and being able to help people but there homes and town back together was an opportunity of a lifetime and I'm clad I was able to do it with my Friend Don.  "
I believe that disbanding electoral college would be in favor of most peoples decisions. This way everyone has a chance to vote decisively and not having electoral college decide who should be the President of the United States. Electoral college docent let the people decide who they want to be president. It lets the slate of electors decide which is totally un fair in my decision. People are the ones who elect which president they feel will make the United States a better country. Many the slate of electors have a different decision in mind than what the people of America think about who should be president.
"Popular vote would be much better in my decision because it gives everyone a chance on picking there president and not having other people pick it for them. Say there was a tie in the electoral votes, then they would be passed onto the house or reps were state delegations vote on the president and not the people of America. There is a greater quantity of people than there are slate of electors and House of Representatives. The electoral college is completely unfair to voters because in each state candidates don't spend time in states they don't think will help them win presidency. We the people don't have the ability to choose who we want as a president, and we want our freedom of being able to do that. There will be fewer conflicts and anger from the people if they disband electoral college."
"But in many eyes electoral college are in favor to those people. They think it's right to have the slate of electors vote for whom they think would be a better president. The electoral college does avoid the problem of elections in which no candidate receives a majority of the votes cast. But it could lead to more pressure in the election process, which could greatly complicate the presidential elections. There for saying that electoral college ISIN a good decision to have. People should decide what they want to have for this country. They should be able to take a mark and say we don't want electoral college anymore for the United States."
"It would have to be weighted in an election of the people to decide what they want to have. Electoral college method of selecting a president may have a big impact on people by not choosing the president they want. Saying in the peoples minds that Electoral College should be disbanded and gotten rid of because it depends on what the people of the U.S. choose, not the slate of electors."
"The author of this story does not support the idea of Venus being a worthy pursuit despite the dangers. In this article, there is only evidence supporting all the challenges that Venus brings to us. The author gave no reason or claim to why a dangerous trip to Venus would benefit us in any way. The author of this article does include evidence and facts about how hard it would be to get to Venus and all the challenges we would have to undergo to get to Venus."
"In this article the author claims that going to Venus is hard but worthy. What makes Venus so worthy? ""Often referred to as earth's ""twin"", Venus is the closest planet to earth in terms of density and size."" says the article of this passage in paragraph 2. But then in paragraph 2 he states that Venus has a ""thick atmosphere of 97 percent carbon dioxide blankets"" and ""clouds of highly corrosive sulfuric acid"" ""temperatures over 800 degrees Fahrenheit"" and"" atmospheric pressure is 90 times greater than what we experience on our own planet"". The author gave all this evidence of the challenges we were facing to get to Venus, but he does not say why it is beneficial to us. He gives us more reasons to not want to go to Venus."
"In conclusion, this author does not support his claim of Venus being worthy despite all the dangers and challenges it brings. There is no text evidence or even a reason to go to Venus. The author has to include more of the benefits we can get from going to Venus, instead of giving us all the challenges. "
"I agree with the claim against the value of using this technology to read student's emotional expressions. First off, we perform these calculations every day, as we can tell if our friend is happy or sad by looking at their face most of the time. Also, video imagery tells us that the facial emotions for each emotion are universal. Another big reason is that we really don't know just how many computers can do, it can be where computers detect whether you're happy or sad."
"Performing this calculation every day, we would have trouble describing each facial trait that conveys happy, worried, etc. However, we can also use human anatomy to help paint precisely enough to convey specific emotions. New computer software has anatomical information as electronic code. Video imagery which is the new emotion-recognition software which tracks these facial movements in a real face or in the painted face of Mona Lisa. The software can detect mixed emotions by weighing the different units. We really don't know how much the computer can do, it can detect if you're happy or sad, and make computer-animated faces."
"In a whole, this is a lot to disagree with, since computers are taking over our world now, so I believe this is a great idea. Reason being is that we have video imagery, the amazing and undiscovered knowledge of a computer, and our own brains because we calculate expressions on our own every day. These all major factors that align with the fact that I believe technology should be able to read students' emotional expressions."
"The so-called"" Face'' on Mars is just a landform that looks like a face. I know this because there are no such things as aliens, if aliens did exist we would have seen them and known by now, and lastly I know that I is just a landform because it looks like a coincidental landform that looks like an alien."
"The first reason that I know it is a landform and not an alien is because aliens do not exist. They are some made up characters found in science fiction books and movies, just like monsters, witches, and ghosts. There has never been actual scientific evidence that proved any of those things to be real. Many crazy people think that they have encountered ghost sightings and other things like demons, zombies, or even something as dumb as slender man. These things are all fantasies that they make up in their heads and then try to get other foolish people to believe them."
"The second reason that I know that it is not an alien is that if aliens and monsters really did exist we would have all known by know. If they were anything like what they are in movies we would all be dead or abducted. In movies people see UFO's, and they suddenly are sucked up into a portal and abducted by aliens and used as slaves. If they existed you would think that many people would probably have gone missing after ""UFO"" sightings. Like I said before it is just a bunch of nonsense that people have made up in their head and aren't smart enough to know that it isn't true."
"My last reason that I know it isn't an alien is because I know that landforms can often look like things that they really aren't. For example at my uncles house they have a big rock in their backyard that looks a lot like a groundhog. I know that it is not a groundhog, but if I was like the people that thought it was an alien I could make up a bizarre story about how in ancient times the groundhog got cursed and then was turned into a rock because the king demanded it to."
See? It just doesn't make much since.
"Sure, the landform looks somewhat like a face in the 1976 picture, but so did the rock in my uncle's backyard. All the thoughts of it being an alien is so made up in their heads. The NASA crew said, ""NASA's Viking 1 spacecraft was circling the planet, snapping photos of possible landing sites for its sister ship Viking 2, when it spotted the shadowy likeness of a human face. An enormous head nearly two miles for end to end seemed to be staring at the cameras from a region of the Red Planet called Colonia. First off, the aliens in sci-fi movies aren't nearly two miles long, not even close to that. Secondly where it says that the head seemed to be staring up at them, obviously if you are above it, and it's a 2d or 3d shape it's going to appear to be looking at you!"
"In conclusion there is no way that the so-called face on Mars is an alien. It's not an alien because aliens don't exist, we would have known by now it aliens really existed, and some landforms are shaped like odd things. Like I said earlier, if aliens really existed we would have encountered them before and seen UFO's that would try to abduct us. This is why there are no such things as aliens, which means the face on Mars is just a landform that just so happens to look like a face."
"When people ask for advice, they sometimes talk to more than one person, and they do that because you can see different view points, it will help you decide on a better choice, and if you only talk to one person they may not give you good advice."
"Seeing different points of you view is very important when it comes down to choices, and that could be choices that might change your life. What I mean by different points of views is different ways of seeing things, because one person might only think one way about a choice. Asking multiple people really help you see things in ways you might not have thought about. If you only ever asked one person what they thought about a situation you might only ever think one way because you aren't expanding the thought process if you only look at it in one way."
Another reason why you should ask multiple people for advice is the fact that then you can make your decision based off of the advice you received.
"When asking multiple people for some advice (whoever you do ask) they might tell you think that are good, but they might also tell you think that can be bad. That's why asking more than just one person can be beneficial."
"There are always two outcomes of a decision, and most of the time it comes down to being between a good and a bad outcome. So make sure that you think hard when you make your decision, and pay attention to what advice the people give you and some of the things they say to you, because making a good choice can be pretty especially with things like pure pressure. Make sure you ask more than one person, because it can be the deciding outcome of a good or bad choice."
"My last reason that you should talk to multiple people is that if you do only talk to one person they might be a bad influence on you, or they might only give you one way of thinking."
"My point is that you should try asking a different amount of people you trust and that you know give good advice. Try asking more adults or people older because 9/10 they will give you better knowledge and advice of a situation, and that's because they have lived longer, and they are most likely wiser than other kids your age. Ask close family members, and the people who know you the best, but also make sure that they are being mindful at the same time."
"In conclusion making the right choice can be difficult, but if you remember to ask the people you trust, look at the decision and see it in different perspectives, and make sure to make a good choice then deciding on a decision or choice won't be all that hard."
I think that studying Venus is really worth a try due to the opportunities that we might be able to study its surface.
"Even though we do not have the ability to send machines or humans, we would be able to see what things are on its surface"
The author shows that it's a worth pursuit in paragraph 7 when he talks about machines like mechanical computers which might be able to make it there.
"He says, ""systems that use mechanical parts can be made more resistant to pressure, heat, and other forces."""
Another example the author gives in paragraph 5 is that humans can go see Venus with its atmosphere with a technology to keep them safe.
"The solution would ""allow scientists to float above the fray"" which is not a bad idea to keep them from getting hit by flames of radiation."
"Traveling to Venus would be good because we humans could see how far we can go, and we could expand our technology to a whole new level to study other planets too."
It would expand our goal to many horizons to study its many surfaces and this idea to see what's inside the most dangerous planets in the universe.
"Astronauts risk their lives by exploring the different planets in our solar system. In the article ''The Challenge of Exploring Venus'' talks about how dangerous it could be to explore it. Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers it presents because it was once the most Earth-like planet in our solar system, Venus can sometimes be our nearest option for planetary visit, and NASA is working on other approaches to studying Venus."
"Venus may be inhospitable now, but it was once the most Earth-like planets in our solar system. In the article it discusses how Venus was probably covered largely with oceans and could have supported various forms of life, just like Earth. It states that, ''The planet has a surface of rocky sediment and includes familiar features [like] valleys, mountains, and craters.'' Meaning it has some features that are analogous to those on Earth. Venus is also the second planet from our sun."
"Earth, Venus, and Mars orbit the sun at different speeds, which could lead to planetary visits. ''The differences in speed mean that sometimes we eye closer to Mars and other times Venus.'' Humans have sent numerous spacecraft to land on this cloud draped world. Each previous mission was unmanned, and no spacecraft survived the landing for more than a few hours. Venus has proven to be a very challenging place to examine more closely."
"There are enhancements that NASA are trying to improve for different approaches to studying Venus. The author exclaims, ''A thick atmosphere of almost 97 percent carbon dioxide blankets Venus.''"
An example of what NASA is trying to do is to create simplified electronics made of silicone carbide that have been tested to in a chamber that stimulates Venus's surface; this electronic has survived three weeks in such condition. What's even more challenging are the clouds of highly corrosive sulfuric acid in Venus's atmosphere. So imagine exposing a cell phone to acid or heat capable of melting tin.
"Around the world, cars are the main use of transportation. The exhaust from cars causes pollution in the air worldwide. By limiting car use, you can easily cut the pollution levels released by cars in half. There are many great aspects of limiting car use. Some international cities have already set a day when citizens do not use their cars. Limiting car use is a great option for the environment. As it can help many individuals from all around the world."
"In the city of Vauban, Germany, most citizens do not even own vehicles. ""70 percent of Vaughn's families do not own cars, and 57 percent sold a car to move here."" Rosenthal, 3 Vauban claims to be a car free community. The banning of cars is a ""growing trend in Europe"" Rosenthal, 4 The movement is called ""smart planning."" Rosenthal, 4 Cars play a huge roll in polluting the Earth. ""Passenger cars are responsible for 12 percent of greenhouse gas emissions in Europe... and up to 50 percent in some car intensive areas in the United States."" Rosenthal, 5 The ""environmental Protection Agency is promoting ""car reduced"" communities."" Rosenthal, 9 Limiting car use is a huge benefit for the Earth and people living in it."
"In Paris, France, the pollution levels are increasing drastically. For that reason, Paris has decided to ban driving for two days. Citizens who failed to not drive were punished with a 31 fine. ""Congestion was down 60 percent in the capital of France"". Duffer, 14 This statistic shows that by the limiting of car use, traffic levels may change drastically. From the lower use of cars on the roads, the smog above Paris was clearing and moving towards Beijing. Which is ""one of the most polluted cities in the world."" Duffer, 14 The main cause of the pollution is diesel fuel. France in particular favors' diesel fuel. ""Diesels make up 67 percent of vehicles in France"". Duffer, 16 This is the primary cause of the pollution in the city. By banning the cars, the city received clarity from the smog surrounding it prior to the ban."
"In Bogotá, Colombia, one day a year they ban all cars despite public transit. They have been doing this for three years. If a citizen failed to obey the car ban, a 25 dollar fine was given to them. Businessman Carlos Arturo Plaza stated, ""It's a good opportunity to take away stress and lower air pollution."" Selsky, 24 The car ban is part of an improvement campaign from the mid1900s. Rain or shine the residents of Bogotá still participated. This past year two additional cities participated in the movement. The movement has shown great success and has been helping with pollution and stress many individuals face daily."
"In the United States of America, President Obama wants to lower the rate of greenhouse gas emissions. Studies show that ""Americans are buying fewer cars, driving less and getting fewer licenses as each year goes by."" Rosenthal, 29 In 2005, there was a peak of the miles driven. In 1995, this was 9 percent lower this was also the case in April 2013. Michael Silva, an individual that studies the trend and who is a research professor at the University of Michigan's Transportation Research Institute said, ""rates of car ownership per household and per person started to come down two to three years before the turn down."" Rosenthal, 33 As the years have past, the numbers of car owners have decreased. Although the idea of limiting car use sounds like a great idea, it will eventually hurt the automotive industry. People will stop purchasing cars due to these bans."
"There are many widespread advantages to limiting the car use of individuals around the globe. Greenhouse gas emission levels are essentially rising. By taking action and limiting car use, the world can decrease these levels. Less use of vehicles can help relieve stress, a condition a lot of people face around the globe. It is truly amazing that by banning cars for a day, the surrounding smog was clearer in Paris. The widespread happiness in Vauban, Germany due to carefree living is another great outcome. Bogotá's influence on two other cities is also very empowering. Limiting car use is not as bad as it may seem. In the long run, it will benefit our surrounding environment."
Sciencetists say it's worth to discover even more about Venus because I could maintain humans in the future. But also give use resources to support human life
"Bad things why we shouldn't go to Venus is scientists say it's not worth to take risk because it could are human nature because of the temperatures in Venus up to 170 that could cause harms for many humans they are allergic to the sun, and it will take years for us humans to travel to Venus since it the second plant on the solar system ti could take us years to be able to reach are point. Also machines can't be able to survive in Venus because the neatness and the weather on the planet. It also has a lot of challenges for scientists because they still have't discover the whole plant on Venus it could still have dang roues things before we go and live in it."
NASA is working on the machines so that we could be able to see what Venus still has for us humans. Can it support humans or not.
Reasons we should go so that if earth gets destroyed we could go to a different plant and mainline human life again. It could gave us more human resources for oil gas and many more. But also Venus has a value for the solar system 
Dear Principle
I think that students should be allowed to have cell phones during free periods and lunch times. I think this because students use cell phones during those times anyway. Students can use cell phones during school without getting caught during school and don't really care if they get caught. Allowing cell phones during free time can let them check things like e-mail or Facebook and let them talk to their friends.
Another reason to allow cell phones in school is that they can lead to better grades. This is because if students can use them during free time they won't have to use them during class witch can cause them to pay more attention to the subject. If students pay more attention during class it can lead to better grades.
These are the reasons I think cell phones should be allowed in school. I hope this affects your decision to change the cell phone policy in school.
In the article the author describes that Facial Action Coding Systems (FACS) can help to identify human emotional expressions. Prophesier Thomas works with another guy named prophesier NICU. Prophesier NICU was from the University of Amsterdam. I'm against the value of using computer technology to read students emotions.
"One example that the author gives is where the process begins. The text states"" the process begins when the computer constructs a 3-D computer model of the face"". The FACS has classifies six basic emotions which are: happiness, surprise, anger, disgust, fear, and sadness. These emotions are associated with the movement of the facial muscles"
"Another example that the author gives is web ads on your screen. The text says ""if you smile when a Web ad appears on your screen, a small might follow. Most student that communicate is nonverbal. Dr. Hung put that video games and surgery on his notes."
One value of having technology might help teachers know what students might be feeling even if the student doesn't want them to know. If the student is feeling sad or stressed the teacher can help with that through communication. Empathy is (feeling someone else's emotional state).
"To wrap every thing up some people would like to have this technology, but there are some people who don't. The people who would like it thinks it might help them find out what their kids or kid is felling and help them out; however, the people who don't think it would because they hope the kids would come and communicate with them indited of them finding out on a technology computer."
Help Change the World
"Wouldn't you like to help countries recover from ruins World War II left? Well now you can the UNRWA is hiring ""Seagoing cowboys"" to care for animals that were shipped overseas. It would be nice to join and be known as someone who did something for a country, helped keep animals safe and healthy, and helped countries recover their food, animals, destruction etc."
"First It must be a good feeling to be known as someone who did something for a country. Although not everyone may agree, not only will others be amazed but you, yourself could be proud of yourself. Someone once made nine trips which was the most of any Seagoing cowboy. Also, you can be a hero to millions by doing one great action. Overall this can be a great lifetime opportunity for many, and you can be one of them."
"Also, how amazing would it be to know you helped keep animals safe and healthy. However, others may not agree, many innocent little animals pass away because no one was able to save them. But you can make that difference. Caring for the animals during crossing keeps you busy. Especially if you are an animal lover this job is just perfect for you!"
"Finally, helping countries recover their food, animals, destruction etc. is like a miracle to them knowing someone is trying to change the world. Of course not everyone believes this is true, but put yourself in their shoes imagine you lost your house had no food and no one came to rescue. But then that one person comes and changes everything for the better. You can do it everyone can even just by doing the smallest kind of act you can make a difference. Keep that in mind it'll not just be a better world for you but all of us."
"Doing something nice, even the littlest act can lead you a long way. You earn respect, respect isn't given it's earned, and it's not hard to earn it if you do it the proper way. So what are you waiting for there's a world out there waiting for you to change it. And going the Seagoing cowboys program is a fabulous start! Good luck!"
"In my personal opinion the technology come here to help to us in many positive ways. Such as, shopping online, make a bills payments, now I don't need to go to the stores to buy something I need it. This method make me save time and something save money as well, because in some case online purchase are cheaper that go buys straight to the store. Make online payments is one of the most part I like to do using the technology, because make me save a lot of time. Back day I have to make a longer line in the stores to make my payments now I can do it from my house. When you buy something online now, you don't need to speak with someone to make a decision because the stores website are really specific with their products, they give to you the details on what are you looking for and most the time give an exact image how the products are."
"Sometimes you can have fun time using the technology, play videos games is one of the good things we can do with the technology, with the videos games you can meet new people from different part of the world, there exist some videos games provide you that option. Learn new things always is good. This is a new type of style or life that most the people like it."
"Thanks to the technology by Email, my and my daughter teacher have more communication, the teacher always keep me inform how my kid is doing in the school, Also that way I know all the event my daughter school have schedule."
"The technology is helpful for everyone because help to everyone improve our knowledge, make our life easier to handle it. In most the job the technology is using as a new tool, emails is the best way to share information in the work now. Someone who know how to use the technology right, that person is value for two people."
"In conclusion, The technology is the one of the most important things we have in our life now, if you are using it, you should realize is worth it."
"I disagree, because it should not have to be something you must do after school. Students should have a choice on if they want to stay after school or not. Some students are usually busy after school and don't have time no matter what activity. A lot of students do sports and some even very seriously, which means they have practiced a lot. After school, they would not have time to stay because they need to get to practice in order to be successful at the sport they are playing."
"Older students usually work. Meaning either on the weekends or after school, they might have to work to support their family or themselves, and to successfully do that they will need to work more and harder. Staying after school can cause lack of hours or cause their shift to go a few hours forward, which can lead to getting off their shift rather late and have trouble waking up or paying attention in school the next morning. For an example students usually work at supermarkets, fast food restaurants or even babysitting. They either babysit for money or their own siblings for when their parents don't get home after school. Students would have to get home immediately for the safety of their younger sibling and to make sure he is taken care of."
"On the other hand staying after school would maybe help, but mostly for students who will not be busy after school. There are activities like sports, helping/working on yearbook, and serving on student counsel. Students who do these are usually free after school and have nothing to do, so to ease out their boredom these would be very fun. Then there are also students that won't have a parent home after school to take care of them causing them to stay for an after school activity without a choice. At last there are athletic kids who just want to stay after school for fun sports or even non-athletic ones who just want to learn how to play a sport."
"I still stick with my opinion even if there are benefits to staying after school for some students, but most still gain nothing from it. In my opinion working and going to practice after school will gain you more benefits especially for the future. Working can help prepare students for college. If they save enough money they would not have to get a huge student loan which would cause them to have debts in the future. Sports can also help a lot of students in the future. Working hard and attending every game and practice will get them better at the sport and can help them get a full ride scholarship to a college, so they wouldn't have to get a student loan or get money from their parents. Some may even have a chance at D1 which can possibly lead them to play professionally. "
"The ""face on Mars"" is not a real face. The face is a mesa or butte that looks like the ones found in the American west. It looks like a face by the shadows that form on it. The camera that found the ""face on Mars"" was old, and later a new one took a picture that can clearly see the surface. The new camera cannot be argued with because it is the latest and clearest. Also, why would NASA try to hide the fact that there were aliens on Mars when it would clearly benefit them a lot."
The mesa or butte on Mars is nothing but so. Saying that the government is hiding something like that kind of sounds dumb. If you think about it in the way I do it would be like an alien race looks down on our planet saw a mesa that looked like a face and thought we knew he was there and wanted look at him/her/it.
"Also, don't you think NASA would have made a bigger deal about the ""face"" it was a real face. All in all the face just got blown out of proportion when it is just a rock."
"If you are about to blame the camera and say it was the cameras fault and how it is a face and not a mesa you are wrong. First: NASA stated that they would take a better picture, so why would they lie? Second: NASA would not spend all the money it took to get the spacecraft up in space to take a picture if it was not real. Third: if they did spend the money to get it up there why would they send a crappy camera? Fourth: NASA also stated they are going to wait for a clear day too, so it is not clouds. The camera was fine, the weather was fine, and the image is completely real too."
"If the was really aliens on Mars it would benefit them a lot. Think about it why would NASA lie about something helpful. If there were aliens on Mars NASA would get billions and billions of dollars to study them. Also, if there were aliens why would we keep it a secret any way, because what if they had technology we didn't wouldn't we already have it? If there were aliens wouldn't they have already discovered us, so if they had bad intentions we would already be at war."
"The ""face on Mars"" is totally fake. Now that I've bestowed upon you my knowledge maybe you can pass it on to other conspiracy theorists. Then maybe the ""face on Mars"" thing will finally blow over. Next time something like this happens you can probably look into that further too. Also, may be just maybe conspiracy theorists might come to an end.  "
"Advice. Advice is something you seek, and search you can ask advice on anything it can be advice for you hair, advice for you dog, doctor advice you can partially ask advice on anything. When people are searching for advice they usually ask more than one person, I think that's best, because you can see from different points of views. I think only taking one person's advice may not help you find a solution or a make a good a choice, another positive thing about asking advice is you can also learn something new or meet someone new."
"Asking multiple people is better than asking one person for advice, because only asking one person may not get you the advice that is best needed. Asking multiple people for advice is something that can help you find a quicker solution. There are many positive sides when asking people for advice, like having different points of views that can give you tons of ideas and information for the advice that you are looking for. When you are gathering all these opinions you can discover new information and the advice you are looking for."
"There are many positive sides when asking multiple for people advice. When you ask people for advice it could be a stranger, a family member, a friend. Entire way you are communicating with others, and you can make friends while asking the for the advice you are looking for. You can learn new things about you friends, and family members, when you ask them for advice. You can also meet someone new and develop communicating skills."
"When you ask for advice it's best to ask more than one person. I think that is a good idea to see from different points of views and asking multiple people because, you discover different opinions and ideas. Only taking one person's advice may not help you find a solution or a make a good a choice."
You can also learn something new or meet someone new when asking someone for advice. 
"The limiting of car usage can be very useful in today's society. The emissions of gas and diesel vehicles are at the top of the chart when it comes to pollution of the atmosphere. But not only pollution, it could cause a lot of people to become a little healthier if we walked, ran or biked somewhere instead of taking a five-minute drive to the convent store."
"In many major cities of the world, air pollutants have become a danger to the health of not only our lungs but also to the earth. The gasses that are emitted build up in our atmosphere making a thick barrier that traps other gasses inside that are intended to be set free. Paris, France had one-hundred and fourty-seven micrograms of particulate matter per cubic meter."
"A lot of citizens of these large cities are combating the pollution problem by putting bans on cars and car usage. But most are cutting back due to there not being a ban where they live. They choose to walk, run, bike, skate, etc... This creates a healthier way of life for these citizens as well as saving the planet. They are saving our world just one step at a time."
"So as proved in these articles, there are so many positive things that can come from the restriction of automobiles. Including The preservation of Earth itself.  "
"Technology is gradually developing as we go into the future. New inventions are being created every day, such as driveless cars. When you think of driveless cars you may picture things like you see in the movies, but they are much more complex. I personally think that the development of driveless cars is a good thing and will benefit us later in the future."
"In the article, the author believes."" Driveless cars will use half the fuel of today's taxis and offer more flexibility than a bus"". As you can see driveless cars will benefit the earth and the needs of humans. The company, Google, has had independent driving cars since the year 2009. Their research states that their cars have driven more than half a million miles without a crash. This research shows that the developing of driveless cars is improving and actually becoming a product that will later be in use."
"Although these cars are categorized as independent, they still require the alertness of the driver. The car itself will need the driver's assistance when pulling in and out of driveways or dealing with traffic issues. I believe that the car not having complete independence will actually benefit the driver. Since drivers today are already being distracted by phones and passengers, not having complete control could help them be safer on the road. I appreciate how the car can move on its own, but also requires the driver to be somewhat aware of what is going on. Let's face it humans will always be distracted, but not having to actually drive a car might reduce the number of accidents caused by texting. I know it sounds crazy that the driver not paying as well attention, but with the car driving on its own the driver would be able to text and get distracted."
"Driverless cars are improving scientific research and inventions. Back to the benefits of the driver just having to be aware, technology has helped so much in the process. The car can steer, accelerate, and brake themselves. Scientist and workers were also able to create a liberating sensor in the seat to help the driver be aware when the car needs assistance such as in a traffic jam. The information from the sensors can cause the car to apply brakes on individual wheels and reduce power from the engine, allowing far better response and control than a human driver could manage alone. The author believes, ""Manufacturers are also considering using cameras to watch that drivers are remaining focused on the road"". I believe that this would be a great idea and will improve the drivers safety. I know that driving might not be as fun and people will use interest if all they do is sit there, but then they will be able to text and do whatever else they are prevented to do when actually in control of a car."
"In conclusion, I believe that driveless cars will actually benefit us later in the future. Its high-tech equipment and special sensors will fascinate people and lead to the purchasing. I believe that allowing product in other states will improve transportation systems and the needs of people. I predict that in the future, there will be other independent vehicles and systems being created. Driverless Cars are coming and we better be ready."
"Driverless cars are becoming more popular in today's society. Driverless cars can be very useful to people today. They can help prevent many accidents on the roads today. They can be used by someone from every age group that is able to drive. Young adults, middle-aged people, and the elderly can all use the driverless car to help improve the roads in today's society."
"For example, many parents might feel better knowing that their child is on the roads using a driverless car that is less likely to cause an accident. Teen drivers today are distracted when they first begin to drive. With a driverless car, however, teens could possibly get distracted but would not cause an accident. The car could continue driving for them. If the cars could accelerate for the driver, they could also prevent the driver from speeding. This would prevent many young adults who are less experienced on the roads from being pulled over by a police officer and given a ticket. Many parents may also become distracted while driving with young children. Young children need attention from their parents, and while in a car children tend to distract their parents more often usual. When a parent looks away from the road and to the backseat where their child is sitting, even if they are only looking away for a few seconds, they could run into the oncoming lane of traffic or possibly a ditch. With driverless cars, these accidents could be prevented. As long as the parent or teenager has his or her hands on the steering wheel, the car will drive itself. With BMW's ""Traffic Jam Assistant"", the driver would be able to look away from the road and the car would still be able to steer, accelerate, and brake themselves. In case of a work zone or accident, the driver would be notified, and they would assert their attention back to the road. This ""Traffic Jam Assistant"" would be useful while a mother needed to tend to her child in the back seat or while a teenager talked on the phone to their friend. The driverless cars would not be just for teenagers and middle-aged people, they could be used by elders as well. Often you will hear on the news or radio about how an elderly person fell asleep at the wheel and rear-ended the car in front of them, sometimes causing a bad accident. With the driverless cars, elders could possibly fall asleep, or they could be just as distracted as a young adult on the road, and still not cause an accident. As you age, your senses start to dull and that impairs your driving. This could possibly cause an accident. With the driverless car, elders can still drive and not have their dulled senses impair their driving. Driverless cars could save many lives each year and prevent numerous accidents."
"Driverless cars could be a huge advance in today's society. Driverless cars are safer than a car driven by a person. They could possibly prevent accidents and many deaths each year. By using a car that could drive itself, you could make today's roads safer and easier to navigate."
"""School activities can help a student grow, learn, and be taught more about adulthood."" said Generic_Name. My principal has made a policy where a student must take at least one extracurricular activity. The school gives lots of choices like sports, student council, and you can also work on the yearbook. You can find many more of the activities through your school website. I agree that all students should participate in an extracurricular class throughout the year."
These activities the school has for you to participate in could help make you friends. You could make friends by joining the soccer team and connecting with new people. Making friends could help stop bullying or lower the chance of it for you and your friends. Making friends could increase the grades of yours since you have a friend to help you when in need. Extracurricular classes could start some really great friendships during the school year.
"One other important thing a school activity could help with is finding a job. Kids don't usually know what they want to be when they enter high school or even college, so maybe these activities could help young kids get an idea of what they like to do. Helping kids find out what they like to do could really help the kid see what he or she would like to be in the future. This could also help kids get used to what they want to do, and then when they enter college, they will already know what they want to try. Extracurricular classes or activities will increase the percent of how many kids know what they want to do when they grow up."
"Extracurricular activities could help make school and life more fun. Fun is something a child or kid needs in their life, and elementary school through middle school should be fun times. These activities like sports and other things could really help you have fun in school or out of school. Playing a sport you love can help make friends and show you what your interests are, which makes life more fun. I have also had an experience of playing a sport for the school during my middle school days. It was very fun making relationships with others and I decided soccer was what I wanted to do in college."
"My principal made a policy that says all students must take an extracurricular activity and I agree with this policy. Outside school activities or in school activities or anything like that could help in so many ways to a persons' life. Helping finds a job, having fun, and making friends could all help with the future and the present. These activities aren't just something to skip out on, they are something to try. Trying something new could change someone's life and could help with decisions through adulthood. "
"There are many advantages of limiting car usage. Like conserving resources when we don't drive cars. It also lowers emission and improves safety as said in Source 4: The End of Car Culture. When you stop using cars pollution will decrease. And when the pollution decreases the earth will be healthier. Being able to drive at 16 doesn't help the advantages but between 2001 and 2009 23% of young teens stopped driving. Some advantages are its helps the environment, keeps people safe, and also gets people to exercise."
"The first advantage is that it helps the environment. Cars pollute the air a lot and if we limit the usage of cars then the air will slowly become more clean. Also, the cars cause smog. With the use of cars stopping the smog will clear. As stated in Source 1: The End of Car Culture, the United States has long been one of the world's prime cultures. But as people started to drift away from their cars, the US peaked in 2005 and is still steadily dropping. When here is cold nights and warm days the warmer layer of air traps' the car emissions."
"The second reason with limiting car usage is a good idea is that it keeps everyone safe. The pollution is bad for peoples health. Also, a lot of people actually get hit by cars so listing the use will cause fewer injuries. You won't be always looking out for the pedestrians. Also, kids are the ones who get hit by cars most because you can't see the so no cars means less children getting hurt. Another good thing that will come out of limiting car usage is that we will see less gas, and then we will have more natural resources. Passenger cars are responsible for 12% of greenhouse gas emissions in Europe and up to 50% in car-intensive areas in the US as stated in Source 1: In German Suburb, Life Goes On Without Cars."
"The final reason why limiting car usage is that it gets people to exercise. A lot of people are couch potatoes, especially in America, and don't do anything so having limitations with their car will have to make them move a little. All people like to do is use their phone or eat or watch Netflix on their free time but having no car will make them do more physical things. Having no car all make people ride bikes from point A to point B r even walk. Have fast food places n very corner doesn't help either because it makes people get in their car to drive what could have been a five-minute walk. When ave you have ever seen a person walk to get food? Never."
"In conclusion, there are many advantages in limiting car usage like it helps the environment, KES people safe, and makes people exercise. People are safe. The environment is slowly getting better. People are starting to exercise whether they like it or not. In some countries if you own a car you have o pay $40,000 to have a parking space, along with what you aid for the house.  "
"Not too long ago I got into a disagreement with one of my best friends, this made me a little sad. But something that always helped me feel better was talking to trusted people about it. Receiving opinions from multiple people can help someone decide on a better choice because they can view the other persons' perspective, they will get honest feedback, and they might find out more information on the situation."
"Getting advice from different people can help you see multiple perspectives on the situation. The trusted person helping you can show you how the other person might be feeling. Sometimes knowing how they feel can change your point of view on things. The friend or family member can inform you on what you did wrong. Even if the opposing person hurt your feelings, there is a high chance you have hurt them as well! If you are confused on what the problem is they can show you what it is or how it started. For me, I need to understand how the problem started before I resolve it. Understanding how the other person felt, knowing what the problem is, and realizing what you did wrong are important things the trusted people helping you can do for you to make a better choice."
"The person you are seeking advice from can inform you with more facts about the situation. They might have gone through the same thing in the past and know how to handle it. I feel a sense of relief to know that they understand what I am going through. If you are talking to a friend they will most likely already know about the situation and can help you out more than you think. Depending on how much they know, you'll have a clear understanding of what happened and feel comfortable enough to make a good decision. Another way you can get more knowledge is figuring out how you can prevent this from happening again in the future. That is something you're gonna need! Getting advice from someone who already knows about the problem, has dealt with the same thing in the past, and keeping the advice for the future are perfect reasons why you should seek advice from not just one person, but a few."
"Lastly, the trusted person who is helping you will give you honest feedback. They will help you choose the best way to handle the situation. It always makes me feel better when the person giving me advice knows how to help me. The person can tell you if your choice is the best or not. You will most likely feel better after getting ""the okay"" from another person. Talking to a trusted person will make you feel more comfortable, especially knowing you aren't getting lied to. By then you will feel ready to make a great choice. Knowing if your decision is good or not, being told how to handle it, and talking to someone who won't lie to you will truly help you decide on a better choice."
"Asking people for advice can sometimes help you make a better choice. Viewing other peoples perspective, getting more information on the topic, and getting honest feedback can help you decide on a better choice. Do you think talking to more than one person can help you make a better choice?"
"As the years go on, and we grow what also grows is the advancement of technology. Since the new era of technology has taken place the possibilities have become endless. Years back they didn't even have electric window control it was all done with a handle that you had to turn and turn until your window opened. Looking back on that compared to this day and age we have cars that are so close to driving themselves is that the safest idea no, but in my mind I think it's a great idea to make self-driving cars because everything technology wise is growing rapidly, so we can't just leave cars old and boring we need to keep up with the technology we have at this time in our lives and make something new and awarding."
"So we all know how many safety concerns we face in cars when on the road and this is exactly why people believe we shouldn't have self-driving cars. Therefore, I believe self-driving cars are getting a bad rep without even getting a chance. If you don't test an idea you will never know if it would have worked or not and with the technology we have today I believe that in the near future sometime soon we will have a full self-driving car. I understand that it will be hard to do and I agree that it can be very unsafe and so that's where the trial and error part comes in you have to try new things to know for sure if they will work and I can say now that in the near future if we do end up having self-driving cars that everyone who use to say don't try it its not safe will themselves be buying self-driving cars."
"In conclusion, I know that the speculation with self-driving cars is odd, but the real truth of the matter is that that's our future. Every few years new inventions come by surprise and shock the world and this is just another thing that I can confidently say will come soon and take the world by surprise. Will there still be people trying to get rid of this invention? Of course people will try but that's the key to success having people say things about what you have made and making it something so big that those same people will be shocked that ever thought something bad of you. So time is not slowing down for anyone it's going fast and so soon hopefully by 2020 as seen in the article companies can start to announce self-driving cars and change the way we look at cars now."
"All humans face difficulties at all times in their life. Humans aren't always going to be happy every second of every day. In the article ""Making Mona Lisa Smile,"" the author is expressing the new technology, the Facial Reaction Coding System. This is able to identify human emotions. I am against this technology on reading students emotional expressions. Students go through school and come across bad times and stressful times and not every student likes to show that."
"Students go through emotions quite frequently and even when noticing one has a great big smile on their face, doesn't exactly mean they are happy. For an example, in paragraph 5, it states ""For instance, you can probably tell how a friend is feeling simply by the look on her face."" This shows that anyone can make any face just to show one is ""happy"" or ""sad,"" others may not want people knowing how sad you actually are deep down. Everyone is different in their own ways, but for me being a student in high school and if I am ever sad, I show a smile on my face so not everyone is noticing my sadness and asking me what's wrong. Therefore, in paragraph 7,"
"""They even indicate the difference between a genuine and a forced one."" This is showing how the software and the movements in the muscles show the difference between an actual smile and a forced one. Not every student in high school is going to know the difference on the movement in muscles unless they are studying it. There is a reasoning on why there isn't a bubble on top of our heads revealing our thoughts. One good example from paragraph 6 states ""Most human communication is nonverbal, including emotional communication, so computers need to understand that too."""
"If one wants to express how they feel towards a family member, or friend, etc. then that's on them for wanting people to know their business and talk about it with someone else. Understanding the thought of understanding yourself, each and every individual has their own thoughts on things and many things that come across the head is always secured within yourself and never left your mouth which doesn't mean it needs to be notified by a computer either."
"I strongly believe each student should be able to express their feelings how they want, if that means hiding their real emotions or embracing their real emotions. If one is upset and has something going on in their life, they know how they feel and don't need a computer operating all their thoughts. This is why I am against having this software of identifying human emotions."
"There are many ways you can do things without using cars as transportation. In these two sources, ""In German Suburb, Life Goes on Without Cars,"" and ""Car-free day is spinning into a big hit in Bogotá,"" they all explain how you can do things without have to use cars for transportation."
"In the source, ""In German Suburb, Life Goes on Without Cars,"" it explains that in Vauban, Germany, people have given up their cars to live a better, suburban life. In paragraph 3, Hadron Walter states, ""When I had a car I was always tense. I'm much happier this way."" This shows that people can be happier living a suburban life by walking, riding bikes, etc. without having to use a car for transportation. Not only does have this made it easier, but has made the city denser."
"In the source, ""Car-free day is spinning into big hit in Bogotá,"" it explains that in Bogotá, Columbia, people started a campaign called Days Without Cars, which basically is supposed to promote alternative transportation and reduce smog. This is a good way to lower air pollution and help make transportation a lot less stressful. In paragraph 20, it states, ""In a program that's set to spread to other countries, millions of Colombians hiked, biked, skated or took buses to work during a car-free day yesterday, leaving the streets of this capital city eerily devoid of traffic jams."" This shows that without using cars for transportation, there will be less traffic jams, and it will be easier to get to places."
"In conclusion, people prefer to live a suburban life and use transportation without cars rather than with cars. This makes transportation a lot easier, and you can get to places without being stressed out by traffic jams. This also keeps the country less polluted.  "
Your principal has decided that all students must participate in at least one extracurricular activity to do after school do you agree?
"Yes, I agree most people have time after school to join something, people try out for a sport but some of them don't make it, they have something to look forward to after school. People think school is boring but here is a way for it not to be."
"Most people have time after school, some people when they get home just play video games or eat because they have nothing to do, sitting around because there bored. Playing video games isn't good its bad for your eyes and your brain by sitting in front of a screen all day, playing video games doesn't accomplish anything. Eating because your bored doesn't do anything either except make you fat because you're not working out or doing anything it just turns into fat. Sitting around because you are bored than if you're bored do something for the school because they need people for sport teams and other things."
"People try out for sports but don't make it, so they quit, they don't want to do anything, make your own sports club. So they quit because they didn't make it, so they feel like well I can't do anything else. They don't want to do anything because there sad, or they don't want to practice any more because they don't feel like they can make it. Make your own sports club by get a group that didn't make it in a sport and practice together then when tryouts are again your group can try out together, if you try out in a big group there more likely to pick you to be on their team."
"People have something to look forward to after school, do better in school, grades are improving, there liking what they choose. Do better in school, people will get there work done instead of messing around. Grades are improving, people won't want to get kicked out of their groups or clubs, so they will work harder and take it seriously. People will like what they choose, they picked what they like instead of the school picking for them, they actually want to go to their club, sport, maybe their own club if they made one."
"You get to be you and not feel like you can't you fail you try again. If you don't make something you make a group but better. I agree with the principal we should have to do a group or a sport because it's really going to help people with friends, border, grades these are just the little things there are more and more to go on about. Most people have time after school to do a sport or a club, people try out for sports but don't make them, they have something to look forward to after school.  "
"Voting time is here again and it's time to cast your vote for the president, but do you know what really happened when you vote? See the United States Constitution has this process set that the election of a president consists of the selection of electors and each state has electors based on population. Citizens vote for the electors candidate and the electors take the majority of the votes whether it is Democratic or Republican and all votes of that states electoral representatives vote for the states winning president. Crazy right? But is that the most effective way to this and if it is not why shouldn't we change it to something more fare and equal and not leave it up to some special electors. Leave it to the people to decide who we want for our president."
"The United States is a fairly new country compared to others around our world, yet we have some pretty advanced technologies and some really silent ideas but when our founding fathers made the Constitution I don't think they made the best choice. Even some of our previous presidents like Nixon, Carter, Dole, Chamber of Commerce and the AFL-CIO have said we need a better way to elect our presidents. In 2000 Al Gore had won the popular vote and was set on residence but did not win thanks to this outrageous system and lost the electoral vote and lost his shot at precedence. If you win the popular vote doesn't that mean you the fan favorite and the citizens want you to be president because the majority voted for you. During a pole shortly after Gore lost people were asked if we should keep the system we have now or Chang and 60% of the people asked said that we should change. Can't you see the people are dying our for help and asking to change the system, so someone like Gore doesn't get cheater again."
"When campaigning as a president shouldn't you try to visit every state to try and increase to popularity? Well sadly it really doesn't work like that with this current system you see some presidents let's take Obama and Romney as and example. Some States won't see the candidates at all because they ""know"" they will win the electoral votes. Obama in the 2012 election never visited some States like Ohio or Romney and Florida because they knew that the majority would vote for him, and he would win that state. Now how is that fair. If it was up to just a popularity vote each president campaigning would go to every STAE trying to get as many voters as possible instead they say eh I will skip that state because I will get the majority any ways. On top of the electoral system makes smaller states less important because it is set up where more population means more votes. That to me is saying well you a small state so everyone in that STAE you mean way less that this other state. California, Texas, and Florida are the most campaigned States in the US because they have 55,38,29 votes respectively. Now places like Arizona, Ohio, north and South Dakota have six, three, three, and three respectively. How is any of these people less important ADN less valuable the ones in California, Texas or Florida."
"I still can't find a reason why we should keep this system around and the more I think about it the more I want to get rid of it. The electoral college is taking our power as US citizens our of our hands and defies us from voting for the president and in turn makes us vote for special office people. I say leave the electoral system and change to a popular vote wins presidency. This puts power where it should belong, in the hands of the citizens. Who else is with me on banding the old way and taking a new step in the direction of power to the people."
"The topic of driverless cars will be argued until there aren't any humans left. But to simply have a driverless car would be like having an irresponsible parent. Cars were formally made for us to have an easier way of transportation; and now we want cars they can dive themselves. Taking the taxi away from taxi drivers would put them out of business; As well as Uber Drivers and other assistants. How would the generations after us know what to do in an emergency if the driverless car weren't able to function on its own? What would happen to the database of a company if its system crashed, how would signals get out from the cars routers?"
"Having driverless cars would be a bad idea, for one it would take the place of a taxi driver which would take away jobs. Googles cofounder Sergey Brin says ""...a future with a public transportation system where fleets of driverless cars form a public-transportation taxi system. The cars he foresees would use half the fuel of today's taxis and offer far more flexibility that a bus. He believes such cars would fundamentally change the world."" Another reason I wouldn't condone in the submitting of driverless cars would be to save the generation after me. Letting fresh young adults use driverless cars wouldn't teach them how to drive. Which means they wouldn't know what to do in case of an emergency. Yes there would be a manual that you'd have to read. But when it comes to fixing technology and mechanics, humans need a hands-on experience which would help them in case they don't know what to do if the car becomes driverless. Finally, what would happen in a storm if the connection didn't go through or the companies system crashed? Would that mean the car isn't driverless? ""... For starters, they needed a lot of sensors. Google's modified Toyota Prius uses position-estimating sensors on the left rear wheel, a rotating sensor on the roof, a video camera mounted near the rearview mirror, four automotive rarer sensors, a GPS receiver, a ND an inertial motion sensor."" With all of this technology needed to properly produce a smart/ driverless car, would it be necessary? Having this much technology, there would be too many technical difficulties. Which would lead into the owners of the car paying for more that what was even expected."
"The world of technology today has helped us for the better or worse. With smartphones being able to locate people, cars, and places around the world. Sending a typed paper to your teacher just in time before grades come in. Technology has been tremendously helpful. But to have an 18-year-old behind the wheel of a driverless car not knowing what to do in case of an emergency or the car having a malfunction would be pointless to buying your first car.  "
"Dear Senator (name of Florida's senator),"
"I write this letter to you because I know that congress is thinking about getting rid of the Electoral College. The Electoral College has helped us pick a great President and Vice-President multiple times, it might not be everyone's first choice President and Vice-President but most of the time the majority of citizens that care about their country agree with the choice of President and Vice-President. We aren't just electing by the Electoral College vote but also by the popular vote. There might be some problems within the Electoral College method but getting rid of it is not the solution, there will always be some type of issue in the way the President's and Vice-President's are elected, are we just going to get rid of those methods too?"
One reason that getting rid of the Electoral College process is the wrong decision is because our founding fathers established this process in the Constitution as a type of compromise between electing our President and Vice-President by a vote of congress and electing our President and Vice-President by a popular vote of qualified citizens. Why would you want to break that compromise?
"Also, if you think about it, how is it fair on some smaller states if we just did the popular vote. If the majority of a larger state wants someone for President and a couple of small states want another President to be won then most likely the larger state gets the President they wanted, if we got rid of the Electoral College process and just did the popular vote. The Electoral College process also help produce a clear winner of the elections."
"I know that the Electoral College process has some issues like the voters not being able to know for sure who their slate of electors are going to vote for. In some very rare cases the electors do not vote for the candid ant you want them to vote for. That can be very unappealing to most people that they don't have that insurance. Another issue is that sometimes in a close election, the popular vote winner could lose the presidency. Most people don't understand why the popular President lost and imminently assume that the Electoral College process is awful, and we should get rid of it right away."
"Over all, the Electoral College process has been around since our founding fathers were around, and we have had some of the most qualified and caring Presidents that amazed us with how they changed our country for the greater-good and well-being of our country and it's people. The Electoral College process is something that should stay with us for a long time, so that we can see what the next few Presidents will do for us in the future."
"Dear State Senator, I strongly believe that changing to election by popular vote for the president of the United States. Changing the election may increase the hopes for more people to vote. From the passage one of my sources I choose is Source Three called In Defense of the Electoral College: Five reasons to keep our despised method of choosing the President by Richard A. Poster. My second source is Source Two called The Indefensible Electoral College: Why even the best-laid defenses of the system are wrong by Bradford Plume. I believe that sources two and three will get my point across of why changing the election by popular votes for the President of the United States be changed."
"To Begin With, Source Three called In Defense of the Electoral College: Five reasons to keep our despised method of choosing the President by Richard A. Poster one of my example for picking this reason is because it tells us how a map shows a breakdown of the number of electoral votes given to each state. Meanwhile, the Electoral College is widely regarded as an anachronism a nondemocratic method of selecting a president. The Electoral College method is not democratic in modern sense, however, it is the electors who elect the president, not the people. Another example of reasons to keep our despised method of choosing the President is the Certain of Outcomes. In 2000, a dispute over the outcome of an Electoral College vote was possible but, was less likely than a dispute over the popular vote. For example the 2012 election, with Obama received a 61.7 percent of the electoral votes compared to Romney vote 51.3 percent of the popular vote cast. The people should be able to pick there president and so forth. Electron College don't have nothing to deal with the people on who should be president. The Electoral College stands on their on bases of being part of something that belong in the past not the present and just giving candidates plurality."
"So Moving Forward, Source Two called The Indefensible Electoral College: Why even the best-laid defenses of the system are wrong by Bradford Plume one of my example for picking this reason is because Richard Nixon, Jimmy, Carter, Bob Dole, the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, that they all agreed on abolishing the electoral college, and adding that they are not alone, thanks to the quirks of the electoral college winning the popular vote but lost the presidency, over a 60 percent of voters would have prefer a direct election to the kind we have known. What's wrong with the electoral college? Well, let me tell you under the electoral college system, voters vote not for the president but for a slate of electors, who in turn elect the president. Who pick the first electors in the first place? I know the answer to that it depends on the state. It's sometimes the states conventions, the states party central committee, and the presidential candidates themselves. At the most basic level, the electoral college is unfair voters because of the winner take all system in each state, candidates don't spend time in states they know they have no chances of winning and focus on the tight swings states that they may have a chance in. Its official the electoral college is unfair, outdated, and irrational. This is why the electoral college system is wrong."
"To Conclude, State Senator I strongly believe that if changing to election by popular vote for the president of the United States is due to the people choice and not the Electoral College changing the election may increase the hopes for more people to vote. Source Three that is called In Defense of the Electoral College: Five reasons to keep our despised method of choosing the President by Richard A. Poster, and Source Two called The Indefensible Electoral College: Why even the best-laid defenses of the system are wrong by Bradford Plume. I believe that sources two and three will get my point across of why changing the election by popular votes for the President of the United States be changed.  "
"I Think that the technology really can't tell ore actual emotions. I believe this because some people can just pretend to be smiling and look happy but you really don't know what they are actually feeling. They could be sad, angry, depressed we can never know what they truly feel just by the look of someone. Some people just pretend to be okay because they don't want people asking or worrying. But also sometimes you can tell that there is actually wrong with them because the maybe try to act like they are okay, but they really can't hold it for so long."
"Technology can maybe believe that they know someone's emotions by their faces expressions, but the inside is what actually matters if you really know how someone feels. But also sometimes it can be very confusing because they are showing a lot of different emotions, and they are maybe confused themselves. But that's okay a lot of people feel that way. Technology is very smart and its becoming bigger as time goes by but I know and believe that technology can't really know how someone is actually feeling. They can tell by the face but not the true feeling."
"""Does your expression in the mirror suggest an emotion?"" Maybe if you're looking at yourself in the mirror, and you're feeling sad maybe you can see it in your face because its actually you're feeling sad. But someone really doesn't know just by the face just you cause it's you. And it's the same for technology they really can't tell what your emotion is just by looking at you. Unless you're really happy, and sometimes you can actually show an emotion inside and out and if your computer can tell an actual emotion that's true well maybe because you really are feeling happy, sad, Etc. So I believe that technology really cont tell someone's emotions.  "
"Global warming has been said to be a problem for years now. It has been said that we are slowly but surely destroying our o-zone layers. And air pollution is for sure one of the main causes. Smog levels have risen substantially, and it shows, but there are more and more solutions that are beginning to show."
"Germany definitely has the right approach here. They live in what is pretty much a car free society. In a one square mile city of 5500 people, 70% of them do not have cars. Everything in that city is within walking or biking distance, so there is no need for one. Having a society like this is also very stress relieving in a sense. You no longer have the everyday stress of being on a highway or constantly alert for cars, a society like this is for the most part more laid back then a regular one. The amount of exercise is also increased here because you are walking or biking everywhere, you are constantly moving. It is something that every country should take into consideration. The long term effects of pollution will be detrimental to our world, and we know that. Now is our time to fix that."
"Tail pipe emission accounts for 12% of greenhouse gas emissions in Europe and up to 50% in dense cities in the United States. And after near record-breaking pollution in just a matter of days, Paris decided to put a partial ban on driving. By doing this congestion in the city was down 60%, and by doing this the smog cleared relatively quickly. In this short amount of time that driving was partially banned we were able to see a large decrease in not only pollution but the amount of congestion in a city. Not only does this make everyday life safer for everyday citizens but improves the living quality of all people by making the air and world cleaner. Projects like this are showing multiple benefits and great long term affects, not only for car drivers but for pedestrians that are walking the streets to, if congestion in a busy city is down by that much it makes getting around a lot easier for someone who walks/bikes/or runs everywhere. I think It's crucial for people to understand the upsides to having societies like this. Grnated it will be hard to adjust to but the upsides to it will outweigh the cons in the long run."
"A big thing to look at here in one of the benefits of having a car free society like this is not just the pollution but the exercise rate. As Americans we are without a doubt an overweight country and that's obvious. What having something like this would do for us is incredible. Even if it was a one-day thing to try like Bogotá, Colombia. Once a year everyday they have what is called a ""car free day"" where everyone in the city is restricted from using cars unless it is a taxi or transit. This now enforces or allows if you will, everyone to ride a bike, skate, run, or walk to their destination. The streets are left practically empty. When you also do this you can bring improvements to your community. Bogotá went from a cracked unevenly paved sidewalk to the replacement of smooth broad and even sidewalks. Parks and sport centers have increased and blossomed all throughout the city, and you see the community just start to come together as a whole."
"Now with all this being said there obviously are still downsides to cutting out gas producing cars. Weather being a main one. Suppose it rains one day, how do you get to work? Not only that but in warmer climates if you have to go a longer distance to get to your job it gets hot and if you are in your suit and tie you're going to be sweating. If you are a blue collar worker, you have equipment that you have to keep on you at all times not having a vehicle will restrict that. Not being able to drive will also slow down many businesses that travel to someone's home such as a lawn service or a plumber. If you work out of town how do you get to your job? People would have to leave their families and move closer to their workplace if they worked out of town or quit their job. There is a lot to take into consideration when you think about all the possibilities of creating a society like this. And the only way this could work is if it was incorporated the same way that it was for Vauban Germany. If you had a one square mile society where everything was walking distance and your job was in the area then I believe it would be extremely beneficial, but areas like that are few and far between and making areas like that would change the geography of the entire country."
"By no means are we as a country (America) ready to change to this kind of society any time soon, but I do think that in due time we can benefit from this in a huge way. But there is a lot that has to change and our nation as a whole has to be willing to conform to this. There would be a substantial amount of change in this nation if this were to happen and we as a country are not one that necessarily likes change. We like our two car white Pickett fence houses and cutting that out of everyone's lives would no go over well with the majority of Americans. This is something that the future of America needs to seriously take into consideration. Its apparent that we are destroying our world every single day, and we are one of the main contributors. This is our chance to help ourselves and the generation to come, but are we willing to conform and put our luxuries aside for the greater good of mankind?"
"Thousands of people around the world use cars. It's an all-around good mode of transportation. Unfortunately, the fumes that cars emit are harmful for the environment. There are ways to limit car usage. Limiting car usage has many benefits such us the decrease in greenhouse house gas, the decrease in smog, and resources are conserved."
"First off, reducing the usage of cars can cut the amount of greenhouse gas produced dramatically. One can easily cut down on car usage by using other means of transportation such as : riding bike, riding the train, and plain walking. Greenhouse gas emissions are very harmful and are mostly caused by car emissions. Around fifty percent of passenger cars are responsible for these gasses (source 1.) If we limit car usage we can promote a healthier environment."
"Additionally, reducing car usage also cuts down smog. Smog is another deadly gas that isn't just dangerous to the environment, but also to us. Smog is polluted air which can cause sickness. Many cities around the world are increasing in smog due to the overuse of cars. For example Paris almost broke the record for polluted air, which is held by China, one of the most polluted cities in the world (source 2.) If we reduce the usage of cars, we promote cleaner air for ourselves. Just by limiting the car usage for five days in Paris, the smog went down sixty percent (source 2.) The advantage of limiting car usage would be cleaner air."
"Finally, limiting car usage is beneficial because it conserves resources. If we don't rely on cars, we could make cities more compact (source 1.) Therefore, reducing the amount of land destroyed to build malls, highways, and houses. This would save tons of resources that were going to be used on building and natural resources (source 4.) Limiting car usage would improve life all around."
"All in all, the limit on car usage would benefit the environment, it would benefit our health, and it would aid the conservation of resources.  "
"Dear, Principal"
"I have noticed that we need to help our environment and all kids from school should participate in helping. We should all agree in participating. For some reason, after school, almost every kid goes to the basketball courts or other sport, activities. If you are below a ""C"" average you should automatically help clean up the school. Important things from school : school work, paying attention, finishing assignments, finishing home-work, and always come prepared."
"The athletes in the school are needed to be focus in what they're doing. They don't stay focus, there not going to make it in the junior year or senior year in what ever sport there in. Because, school is more important than anything else right now, without school you're not going anywhere nor college or university. All athletes need to stay focus in the want to do, whether its, pro baseball, basketball, football, or soccer, what ever sport your good at, you need to accomplish in life what you want to do. You need a 3.0 GPA if you want to play what you want."
"School is place for learning for kids like you and me. In school, we learn how to listen, write, and pay attention. When we get to college and have a free scholarship and education to where they want to go. School is a great place for you and others that need it."
"Sincerely,"

"Within countries around the world people are coming together, whether it be the politicians or the citizens, they are all beginning to put an end to the use of cars on a daily basis. In Germany there is a suburban city where the majority of its streets are relatively free of cars and the residents of this ""car-free"" city seem quite content. Germany isn't alone in wanting to rid the world of cars along with the pollution and stress it brings, Paris, France is another of the handful of places that would prefer to begin an anti-car revolution. There are days in Paris that, when the smog is too much to bare and the air is hardly breathable, they are forced to enforce a partial driving ban. After about a week the air was noticeably cleaner. While Vauban, Germany and Paris, France have joined the fight in kicking cars to the curb in their own particular ways, three cities in Colombia have also decided to become a member of the ever-growing ""car-free"" city club by starting a program that sponsors a car-free day once a year."
"Taking a closer look at the suburban city of Vauban, Germany, it is easy to see the reason as to why the country would create a city free from cars along with parking spaces. When thinking of suburban cities most people create a mental image of large buildings spread far apart from public homes or neighborhoods with long winding roads and intersections packed with automobiles. Considering most of the popular suburban cities throughout the world match this description, it is not completely inaccurate, but most people fail to also imagine the abundance of smog and other forms of pollution that invade the cities because of the gaseous fumes released by cars and other vehicles. Vauban has greatly decreased the amount of air pollution in their city by simply eliminating the amount of automobiles out on the roadways. According to the article titled ""In German Suburb, Life Goes On Without Cars"" by Elisabeth Rosenthal in paragraph 5, cars are the cause for up to twelve percent of greenhouse gases emerged into the air in Europe while in some areas of the United States the amount of gases released into the air is around fifty percent. By eliminating the amount of cars used in Vauban, Germany they are creating friendly air for its residents to breathe. Going back to the image most people in the world assume a suburb would look like, winding roads seem to take up the majority of space between stores and residential homes. In Vauban, they have reconstructed the roadways and car garages into walkways and new stores, so the residents have more access to the places they need to be. The elimination of the amount of roads and highways have helped Vauban to also put forth more money into other ways of transportations as opposed to using the majority of money on the constructions of highways and such. When reading the article ""In German Suburb, Life Goes On Without Cars"" by Elisabeth Rosenthal in paragraph 9 it states that in most of the previous bills passed has claimed that nearly eighty percent of appropriations have gone to highways while an estimated amount of twenty percent has gone to other forms of transportation."
"Next on the list of cities that are attempting to put an end to car use would be Paris, France. Within Paris there are gorgeous sights to see and the majority of them could be seen and reached by a simple bike ride and there is really no need to fill the air with more pollution with an unnecessary car. This is what most of the people in charge of Paris believe which is why they created partial driving bans. The smog within Paris, France can, at times, rival even the amount of air pollution in Beijing, China which is infamous for being the most polluted cities in the entire world as was said in the article titled ""Paris Bans Driving Due To Smog"" by Robert Duffer in paragraph 14. While Paris officials wanted to completely eradicate driving completely so that the smog would disappear, they knew that with the millions of drivers in Paris that it could not be completely banned all at once. To help illuminate the smog and still keep from having too many issues with its citizens, Paris decided to make it so that one day the drivers with even numbered license plates would not be permitted to drive their vehicles and the next day only drivers with odd numbered license plates were banned from driving. They continued this pattern for a week. Of course, there were some people who decided to drive their cars whether it was banned, so the officials came to the conclusion that anyone who broke the partial banning rule would have to suffer a twenty-two euro fine. According to the article titled ""Paris Bans Driving Due To Smog"" by Robert Duffer in paragraph 12, nearly four thousand drivers were fined throughout that week. Regardless of the people who went against this rule sixty percent of congestion was illuminated in Paris after that week."
"After Paris on the countdown of cities to help the cause of limiting car usage comes Bogotá, Colombia. In this heated city nearly seven million people populate, they have a program where one day out of every year that cars are completely banned from use. Everyone in the population participates by hiking, biking, skating, or taking buses wherever they want to go according to the article ""Car-Free Day Is Spinning Into A Big hit In Bogotá"" by Andrew Kelsey in paragraph 20. By this city promoting the use of buses, taxis, and other forms of transportations they're reducing smog and the amount of traffic jams and accidents throughout their city. After three years of this day being made two other Colombian cities have joined in to participate. The cities being Cali and Valledupar, Colombia. The day without cars was part of an improvement plan that began in Bogotá in the mid-1990s according to the article titled ""Car-Free Day Is Spinning Into a Big Hit In Bogotá"" by Andrew Silky in paragraph 27. By participating in this day, the people of Bogotá have seen the construction of one hundred and eighteen miles of bicycle paths and added parks and sports centers all over the city."
"Within the United States of America there are thousands upon thousands of cars used every day, but this may not last forever. Across the span of around eight years the amount of young people driving and obtaining their licenses has drastically decreased according to the article ""The End Of Car Culture"" by Elisabeth Rosenthal in paragraph 32. More people are taking buses or taxis or simply walking or biking to their destinations because with the growth in population over the last few years the traffic jams are unbearable and seem to take more time than to simply bike to work or school. If a car is used and is needed than most people in America seem to take to car-pooling with a friend or neighbor which in turn helps to decrease the amount of air pollution in the country.  "
"In my opinion, I completely agree with this association church statement. Success consists of going from failure to failure until you get what you're being fighting for, without losing your enthusiasm. However, I realized that the time period it's not the same to the one that we're living on. Company Association, Churches, and Governments are not alike as before, because now if you are trying to achieve something and for some reason you failed, people will start judge on your acts that you're not capable to become your dreams reals. Even though failure plays an important role in the pursuit of success. I would like to share one specific example that fail is the promotion that brings you to success."
"I would like to lasso the example of your first day on your new job. We all passed through that situation, you feel like you're not lace in, in the directions that your boss or supervisor gave it to you to do and thanks to that some employees start laugh at you, about your failure and no one is loyal to come up to you and teaches you how to do it they stand by and wait until they see that you made it wrong then they try to help you. But, let me tell you something that you already know, the world isn't a rainbow it's a very mean and nasty place, and it doesn't matter how rude you are, it would put you into your knees and keep it permanently if you let it. Not you, not me, even no one hits that hard like life does. But, it doesn't care how it hits, the only thing that really cares is about how much you can take, how much you can get hit and keep moving forward. If you know what you worth, then go out and get what you worth, but you must have to be able to hold out hits and not to came and blame others and say; I can't be the person that I want to be, because of him or her, or anybody. That's how winner is done."
"In summary all the proofs plays an important factor in how to be successful in life, sometimes is that shove that you needed to get higher. In addition to this, you have to be able to hold out the criticisms of others, if you are not capable your enthusiasm will get shrink and all the effort would be vainly."
"For centuries, we have followed a certain system established by our founding fathers. This system is called the electoral college. This system is based off voting for the president through electoral votes rather than based off more popular. The state has an overall say through its electors. I believe that this system is unfair and should be abolished."
"The electoral college should be abolished because you are not voting directly for the president. You are voting for an elector who would in turn elect the president. While you may end up pleased, others may feel the complete opposite. I believe that it is unfair to not directly vote for the president because it should be completely up to this nation to elect a president. The system they have set up right now is injustice."
"The second reason the electoral college should be taken away is that the system has much room for failure. Electors could easily betray the will of the people. They have much more power than the standard voter. The electors would completely oppose the most ""popular"" vote and put in their vote for whomever they feel deserves it. This is wrong and totally goes against the idea of giving the people power. This would qualify as just giving a few people power. There could also be room for a tie. This could result in the election ending in the hands of the House of Representatives where the state delegates could choose the president. Not only is this destroying the power of the public, but this could also result in people not getting what they wanted. The delegates could go completely against what the people say because they technically have the right to since they have the power of the situation."
"The final reason the electoral college system should be left behind is the fact that not every state gets to see the candidates. Some of the smaller states that don't count for much of the vote or tend to lean towards a different party don't even get a visit from the candidates. Not only is that unfair, but it's also completely demanding towards the state. It makes the citizens of the state feel unworthy or not important enough for not even making an effort for their vote. This is also a stupid move on the candidates part because they might have been able to persuade the state's vote."
"In conclusion, the electoral college is not a functional system for its characteristic of being completely indirect, for taking away the power of the people, and for its room for error. Although it may seem like a trustworthy system at first, don't be fooled. So what's more important, the power and opinions of the people or the power and opinion of the delegates?  "
"Driverless cars are on the verge of coming out and will be good for all people on the roads. Driverless cars will nit only take away the risk of human error but will help to decrease accidents that are happening all around the world because of human error. Humans make more mistakes than machines, so driverless cars are less prone to be in accidents."
"Machines are very accurate and make very few mistakes if any. As paragraph two says, ""Televisions and movies have long been fascinated with cars that could drive themselves."" Driverless cars would be a huge breakthrough in science and engineering. I think that there shouldn't be any driverless cars right now, but in a few years the technology that will be out will be safe and trustworthy. I would trust driverless cars in a few more years when the technology is more advanced and sophisticated. In paragraph 2 it says, ""Their cars have driven more than half a million miles without a crash, but so far, Google cars aren't truly driverless."" The big car companies agree that the driverless car technology won't be out for a couple of more years because it is too dangerous right now to trust them, they say that cars aren't truly driverless yet when it comes to driving in traffic jams or in construction zones because there are some problems that we probably don't know about yet, but through time we can figure out to make the driverless cars more safe."
"Another reason why driverless cars would be a better go to is because it could help from polluting the atmosphere with exhaust. In paragraph 1 Sergey Brin envisions fleets of driverless cars form a public-transport taxi system that uses half of the fuel that taxi cabs use today. With less fuel consumption, the environment and atmosphere will not get as polluted with gas east. Also, with less fuel being consumed by the cars, There will be less money spent on gas which could help you save money for more things that you want."
"Another feature that you can get from driverless cars is relaxing and spending more time with the people you are with. If you are by yourself you could catch up with the news or take a quick nap and get some extra rest for wherever you are going. In paragraph 8 it says, ""Some manufacturers hope to bring in-car entertainment and information systems that use heads-up displays."" So while you are kicked back in your seat you can turn on a movie or bring a book and enjoy your book while your car transports you to your destination."
"Driverless cars are the future and will bring many technological advances with it. All through time these self-driving cars will come out and amaze the world with all of their abilities. Whether you are for, or against, everyone will be amazed if these sci-fi vehicles are actually produced and used by the common folk. Until then, the world will wait for the best technological advancement in history to come out."
"Dear Principle,"
"Being a woman of intellect and understanding you will understand my decision to say that your new policy may need some thinking over. As a student at your school, I enjoy the classes and social time between them. Yet, I also love sports and Jazz Band. Now, I don't know your history, but I know that you became a principle because you loved the surroundings and the feeling of being in a school. So I ask you why not give that to your students?"
"The school that you run is fantastic, and what makes it just as fantastic is the after school classes. If I'm not mistaken, your policy says that every student must have a grade B average to participate in these classes. This seems fair, but the students at this school are struggling. As you probably know most students at this school have C averages. Their only escape from the confines of the classroom is to go outside and play some sports. Sure, their efforts in the classroom are not the best, but you could help them try harder by maybe adding some extra activities after school. Maybe a half-hour class for homework help, or a catch-up room. By doing this you could not only improve the students academics but also let them play the sports and music they really love."
"Life of a student is challenging. At times, the whole idea of even going to school can cause stress levels to rise. Athletics could be the reason some of your students are showing up for class. To take that away from them is a mistake. For some of your students, getting a B average is simple. But if thirty percent of your school is playing sports, this could look bad for not only your reputation as an outstanding principle, but for the school district. They will think something has gone wrong. For all you know, some kids will be so upset with the new policy they will try even less in the classroom."
"So friend, think about my idea. Add some academic classes and change the new policy and I promise you, happier kids, better grades, and greater reputation will be flowing your way. Sounds nice, doesn't it? I don't have the power or authority to change the policy. You do. Just think about my ideas and think about the kids."
"Sincerely, your friend"

"Who are voters voting for? Whoever they are voting for, it certainly isn't the president. The Electoral College has the potential to cause a nationwide catastrophe, which is why changing the election to popular vote is the best way. The Electoral College should be abolished because of the ""disaster factor"", prospect of a tie, and the fact that more citizens vote in the presidential election compared to the electoral election."
"The disaster factor is exactly what it sounds like: a disaster. This ""disaster"" is described as the event where electors defy the people they are representing. For example, this happened in the 2000 presidential vote when Al Gore won the public vote, but lost the electoral vote to George W. Bush. This means that the electors voted by the people of their state changed their minds about which president they were voting for. This resulted in the opposing vote turnouts in the 2000 presidential election. As said in Source 2, ""In the same vein, faithless electors have occasionally refused to vote for their party's candidate and cast a deciding vote for whomever they please."" Although some people may argue that it is very rare for something like this to happen, the fact that there is a chance that it could is overwhelming. Clearly, against even the smallest odds, the Electoral College can cause a catastrophe."
"A tie would cause a real predicament in a presidential election. In the case of a tie, the choice is given to the House of Representatives. This means that there is an unequal amount of electoral voters. Source 2 says, ""Given that many voters vote one party for president and another for Congress, the House's selection can hardly be expected to reflect the will of the people."" Once again, the Electoral College has faulted a simple tie could throw the whole election off. Why would the vote be passed on to the House if there is already a popular vote? If there is already another vote in place and the votes are counted, why not just put those votes to use? Obviously, if a tie could mess up a national vote, then it's time to change our ways."
"Although each state decides its electors, how many people are actually voting for the electors? According to Source 3, about one half of the eligible American population voted in 2012's presidential election. If only half of the population is voting for a nationwide presidential election, how many people are going to vote for a small, instate election? It isn't clear enough that although the presidential election is bigger, the electoral election is much more important. However, if we just had a popular vote instead of the Electoral College, everyone would vote in the presidential election because everyone already knows the importance of the presidential election. Yet, people aren't aware enough of the importance of the electoral vote and although the government has tried to stress the importance of voting it, nobody seems to catch on. It is evident that a large percentage of the population does not understand the need to vote in the electoral election. People simply do not understand that this election determines the outcome of the presidential election, which is why it shouldn't even exist."
"The Electoral College is regarded as a nondemocratic method of selecting a president. It is true hypocrisy and should be replaced because of the ""disaster factor"", prospect of a tie, and the fact that more citizens vote in the presidential election compared to the electoral election. The presidential election isn't a nationwide election it is an election that takes place in a little room where 538 electors decide the political fate for millions of people living in the United States of America."
"The author suggests that studying Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers it presents because the author wants to study and know everything about Venus. Like how Venus is Earths twin they have the same density and size and occasionally the closet in distance too but the about is willing to take risks knowing that a thick atmosphere of almost 97% carbon dioxide blankets Venus and on the planets surface temperatures average over 800 degrees Fahrenheit, and the atmosphere pressure is 90 times greater than what they experience on earth them conditions are far more extreme than anything humans encounter. Venus has the hottest temperature of any planet its beyond high pressure a heat NASA worked on other approaches to study Venus they simplified electronics made of silicon carbide it lasted 3 weeks in a chamber simulating the chaos of Venus which are erupting volcanoes, powerful earthquakes, and frequent lighting strikes. But the challenge presented by Venus has value not only because of the insight to be gained on the planet itself, but also because human curiosity will likely lead us to many equally intimidating endeavors."
"Venus is the second planet it also is the hottest planet which is never be touched i am spaceship since 3 decades. It is sometimes called ""Evening Star' because it is one on the brightest points of the light in the sky. It was often told that the planet Venus was the twin of Earth because they have the same size, they often send numerous of spaceships to Venus to see if it would work out because when they would send some it would always burn through."
"Venus is a thick atmosphere of almost 90% of carbon dioxide in Venus. NASA's is doing investigations on how they can GP put some spaceships on the planet without during down, so they are using high technology to go check the hot planet Venus. Scientist are working on approaching to study on Venus, so they can be able to let people know more information about it."
"Finally. Venus is a planet close to the sun, its even the hottest planet ever. Nobody wants to go to Venus because its hot, and you can die by going into Venus and knowing that scientists don't want to go put a foot on the planet because they're scared they're going to die or anything bad is going to happen."
"Many people believe the face on Mars is an extraterrestrial being. Although it may seem true, the face is a natural landform. There are many facts to show this is a natural landform."
"Many scientists have seen this face as life on Mars. Some conspiracy theorists have said there is life on Mars, and NASA is trying to hide it from the people. In 1998, Mars Global Surveyor flew over the face, but they revealed there was no face to be seen. There was only a natural landform. Scientists have begun to lose hope of ever seeing the face again. If they were ever able to find the face again, they would have money to do more investigation. Although there were no extraterrestrial beings, people still believed the face would soon appear again. Scientists are still trying to look for ways to explain it all."
"Researchers are still looking for the face on Mars. Scientist Jim Gavin states, ""So, if there were objects in this picture like airplanes and the ground or Egyptian-style pyramids or even small shacks, you could see what they were !"" He is comparing airplanes, pyramids, and small shacks to the face which is no longer there. This statement proves that the face is a natural landform. Many landforms on Earth form then after years or even decades, they decay down to nothing. Although landforms are always forming, they are also being destroyed. Without oxygen on Mars, there is no way the face is able to survive."
"Although the face is not real and is a natural landform, researchers will stop at nothing to prove it is real. Conspiracy theorists are still trying to find the truth. Little do they know the truth has been revealed, the face is just a natural landform."
"Driverless cars are fuel and it is more active than a bus. An article entitled,"" Driverless Care Are Coming"" discusses how the author present both positive and negative aspects of driverless care. In the article, Google cars are not correctly driverless. Some people are argument for or against the development of theses cars."
"The positive about the driverless cars are that it's become smarter. According to the article,"" Antilock brakes and driver assistance still seem a long way from the dream of calling a driverless cab to take us wherever we desire, but Sebastian Thru, founder of the Google Car project, believes that the technology has finally begun to path up to the dream."" A BMW project manager driver stated that, they hope to bring entertainment and important information system. They hope that driverless car can be entertainment and safety."
"The negative aspects of driverless cars is that it would make people boring. It would not be entertainment to wait for people turn to drive. According to the article,""Google's modified Toyota Prius uses position-estimating sensors on the left rear wheel, a rotation sensor on the roof, a video camera mounted near the rearview mirror, four automotive radar sensors, a GPS receiver, and an inertial motion sensor."" Some people argue that, the most important part of technology system is the spinning sensor that on the roof. Some said that, sensor are not new to them because it respond to the hazard of control."
"The argument for the development of these cars are that some states are allowed to use half autonomous cars. So the manufacturers thought that more state would allow limited use of the half autonomous cars. It's continuing saying that, if the technology didn't work and someone is hurt they can't blame the river or the manufacture. So, new laws will be need if the traffic laws change to cover an accident in the future."
The automakers are working on the project for the car driving that can drive themselves around 2020. People are hoping to see this new driverless cars in the future. People believe that driverless cars world change the world.  
"How many kids do community service in your school? A lot of kids in my school do community service at school. Also, most kids participate in sporting events outside of school. Finally, kids should only be forced to do community service if they do something bad. Community service shouldn't be required for students."
"A lot of kids in my school play sports. If they had to do community service after school then they would miss there game or practice. Like everyone says ""practice makes perfect"" and if the kids doing sports don't practice they will get worse at the sport and won't ever exceed. The coach might not have many players and if half of his kids are doing community service he will have to forfeit the game. There is one reason why students shouldn't have to do community service."
"Every kid does community service every day without even knowing that they are doing it. If they play sports, they are doing community service. Also, if they help someone out they are doing community service. Finally, the students are doing community service just by showing up to school. That is just one more reason why the students shouldn't have to do community service."
"Finally, the students should only do community service if they do something bad. Like I said before, students do community service all the time without even knowing they are doing it. Most of the kids that do bad stuff just laugh at the punishments the school gives now. So if they were doing community service it would waste there time and if one of their friends saw them they would be embarrassed. There is the third reason why students shouldn't have to do community service."
Community service shouldn't be required for students. Only the bad kids should have to do community service. Every kid does community service without knowing they are. A lot of kids play sports and would have to miss them to do the community service. That is why students shouldn't have to do community service.
"I can just imagine how the near future ahead may look. From time to time I ask my great-grandmother questions about the life she had growing up and I'm always amazed by the comparison to the life that I live. I have grown up with technology at my fingertips, technology from the alarm that wakes me up to the music I listen to on my iPod when I go to sleep. Growing up I don't remember getting lost and having to ever ask for directions when traveling out of state with my family. We simply used our GPS system. I like watching movies on the car when we go places, and I live the rear camera on the car that helps us drive safely. These new technologies have made our lives much easier and thanks to those bright minds that have created and innovated the technology we have."
"As time goes by, we as a society must make progress, and it's clear that we have. Along with progress comes some disagreements and possible dangers thanks to time and acceptance from our society we have made great improvements from, let's say the time my great grandma was just a young girl. From these I can say that when the question of driveless cars comes up I am all for it. I believe that having to get inside a smart car that ""could drive themselves"", is not a bad thing or idea at all."
"""In the 1980s automakers used speed sectors in the creation of anti lock brakes. Within 10 years, those sensors became more advanced. Since 2009 Google has had cars that could drive themselves under specific conditions."" The improvements cars have made have been done for own advantage and yes, one could argue the dangers of having a driveless car, since a driveless car is not the same as just having better brakes or a Google car that still has a human in control of it, but it's evident that since the past there have been innovations made to cars and our everyday lives that has only led to greater things throughout the decades."
"These new cars have challenges to overcome and these challenges are the reason some oppose the idea and in some states it is even illegal to even test computer driven cars. Some question their safety and liability in the case of an accident but like anything new it has to start from somewhere in order to improve. To this day automakers are continuing their work on the assumption that problems ahead will be solved and as a member of the future I look forward to those solutions and the positive changes it may bring, and I want to be able to share progress stories one day of how far we have come."
"Yes I agree for that all we have that be our selves for put to go out a head we live in the own world where the people judges our behavior and not sees its errors. Because in this world to be being you yourself and don't matter how you are, you have that yourself, always we need remember that you can change the world, not the world change you."
"All of them we have a problem, but we need to learn, follow our dreams I want graduate this year sometimes I think I can't anymore but I have a son I need to follow because he follows me I want change the world for my son he needs make a better person because he need to help other people I want him to follow her dreams."
"We need to change our to think for that change the world we need make major people I need make better people I need help to the people poor, and the ancient people we need change our character because we want a better future for our children they need learn to be Bette people they know our future."
In the school I learn about no judge the people if we have a different type of skin and different color and nationality don't matter in this world all the people are the same.
"I don't change my manner of to think because you need to be yourself. Don't change your ideas to be a big person in the world in conclusion don't worry be happy because the life is short you need to live the life don't matter that the people think follow your dreams"" I want study in the university I want to pass my tests I want a BS a big person that my son see that all can you can make whatever you want if you can, and you want you can."
We can change the world for a world better.
"There have been an incredible amount of car accident caused by using cell phones while driving. There are about 421,000 people injured in 2017 by an accident caused by people that are described by people that are desecrated by looking at their phone. 1 out of 4 car accident is caused by texting and driving. So in response for the accident with a cellphone the government made new driving laws. In California there is now a law that states you cannot smoke and drive and also edibles even the passenger. Sometime people have different reaction time."
Because cannabis slows down your reaction is decreased by 21%.
Here are some helpful way to stay focus at all time when you're driving. Try to talk to the person you see texting and driving to put down the phone while driving to ensure that every passenger is safe.14 % of people say they have seen their parents on the phone. It has been studies to see who is more likely to get in an accident caused by texting. The studies have shown women are more likely to text and drive opposed to men drinking and driving. There are new apps for the phone that can stop all call and texts.
There are new laws that the government have made to put fear in people that like to use their mobile phone while driving.
So that people can stop creating a problem for drivers that use protective driving.
Craig hospital says '37 of the brain is distracted by a cellphone.  
"Venus is the second planet from our sun, and it is periodically referred to as earth's twin. Both planets have the same size and density, but the similarities stop there. The atmosphere of Venus consists of 97% carbon oxide, clouds of sulfuric acid, and the hottest surface temperature of any planet orbiting the sun. Despite this, scientists have tried to send unmanned spacecrafts to the surface of Venus. Scientists think that Venus may have been the most earthlike planet, with the planets surface like valleys and mountains and possible evidence of oceans that may have existed long ago. The author believes that it is worthy to continue trying to explore Venus despite its dangers."
"The author supports the idea that studying Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers by explaining the similarities that Venus has with the Earth and indicating that Venus is the closest planet to the Earth. In the text it states, ""... Venus was probably covered largely with oceans and could have supported various forms of life, just like Earth"" This quote supports my claim because the author gives some evidence that Venus had some sort of body of water. The author might believe that Venus can be habitable. Another piece of information supporting my claim states,"" ...recall that Venus can sometimes be our nearest option for a planetary visit, a crucial consideration given the long time frames of space travel."" This quote supports my claim because the author believes that if the Earth becomes a place that does not support life, the studies of Venus can help us understand and MVE if necessary."
"Venus can be Earth's evil twin, with its poisonous atmosphere and extremely horrific temperatures. The author still believes that research should continue given the similarities between Earth and Venus. He believes that Venus is presenting a challenge and one day, with technology, scientists will be able to overcome it. Perhaps one day we will visit Earth's twin.  "
"The principal's duty is to provide an encouraging environment for the students and to educate the people who want to learn. It's also their duty to provide the same services to one student as to another. Offering only sports or other activities to those that cannot maintain a grade B average at the least is not fair, and the action prohibits those who do not make the cut from enjoying the same as them. Does it truly matter whether a student has a good grade in a sport? What does a mind adept in academics truly bring to the table?"
"There are hundreds of people who have attained scholarships to first tier universities like Harvard or Yale for their ability to play sports, and not for their grade point average. They use their skills in those activities to succeed in life, to pave a career path later on. These people have been playing their sport for years back into their youth, mostly participating in school teams. What would have happened if they had not been accepted into the program for their lack of good grades?"
Not everything has to be about intelligence.
"Students with slipping grades may be a risky choice to accept into a team, but this is an issue of self-esteem here. True, their grades may drop even further with their occupation in their sport, but what truly matters is their confidence in themselves. If their grades were slipping in the first place, then what chance is there of ever getting it back up? Playing in an activity that they love will surely bolster their confidence in themselves, and that is what childhood thrives on."
"Please, principal, consider the following. Childhood is all about relaxation of the mind. Children cannot enjoy themselves in school if they are not allowed the same things that their classmates might be, in cause of a bad grades. This may lead to them to developing a disappointment in themselves, feeling something to be lacking to their person. Barring them from anything at all, like sports and activities, is not for their own good. It is to the students' harm. Let the students enjoy youth while they can, playing for their teams, and possibly create a path in the future for themselves later on."
"Having fellow citizens limiting car usage can have many advantages. Even though there are many reasons, a big topic would be because of the gas getting in the air creating ""smog"" or pollution. Keeping the earth clean but banning cars can make the environment a better place."
"To begin with, limiting the use of cars can be very good for our environment because it would make the air less polluted. As stated in source 2 paragraphs 5,""congestion was down 60 percent in the capitol of France, after five days of intensifying smog..."" that's a big percent and with that we are making the earth green. France even tried to ban cars even and odd to reduce the pollution as being talked about in paragraph 2 and 3. They were being fined if they drove, that is at least until the air cleared up."
"On the other hand, banning cars or not driving is a silly decision. It may be good for our earth and our health, but if you need to leave three hours beforehand to reach your destination on time, then you need to buckle up and step on the gas. If gas so, so bad for the environment, then why don't we ban gas cars? There are many industries and or companies that have created electronic cars. Charging our cars many be difficult for long road trips, but there could be a slot for gas for when our battery level is running low we can get some gas to reach a destination and charge it."
"Having fellow citizens limiting car usage can have many advantages, but also a few disadvantages. Cars can clean up the air but also make us gasp for it. Having a car should be a choice we get to make. Having events and days when ""no cars can be driven, or you get a fine"" is not needed in anybody's lives. What decision would you decide, having a car, or joining in on being green?  "
"School can often be full of work piling up in the classes we don't enjoy, and stress that gets us down. What if there was a way to make school enjoyable for everyone? Extracurricular activities are teams, clubs, and any other organization run by the school. Many students like these because they have something to look forward to while in school, but not everyone always joins. I believe that students should become a part of organizations because it gives them a chance to bond with others, become more involved in their school, and choose an activity that they enjoy."
"In school activities that are outside of class, students have a chance to create bonds with new people. Teams and clubs require working together to make ideas come along, especially student council and sports. This also builds a work ethic for future jobs. Sometimes students may have trouble making friends, so being in a club makes it easy to meet people. Similar interests can also often lead to friendships. Students can also get to know a teacher who sponsors their club better, as many students rarely speak with them in class. Having a more interesting topic to discuss with teachers helps students feel more comfortable around them in class."
"Students should become more involved in schools activities. As a yearbook staff member, I know that from experience. I have been able to go onto the basketball courts during pep rallies to get pictures, inform people and work with them about buying a yearbook, and learn about other class when I take pictures and collect information from them. Similarly to student government, students are able to see their hard work pay off when classmates participate in spirit days and other events. With sports, athletes are able to show off their skill and passion for the game while being able to represent their school."
"Lastly students are able to choose what they want to be a part of. Not everyone enjoys the problem-solving of math or the memorization of history, but it is a requirement to take them. If students join an activity they'll enjoy, then they will have something to look forward to in school. This can also strengthen career paths. If a student is set on becoming a business leader, they can be a part of yearbook or the other organizations that run like a business. If a student is determined to be in the NFL, then they can try out for the football team. And if they don't find a fit for them, they should be able to make a group themselves. It's important to have a variety of clubs, including students' ideas."
"In conclusion, schools should require their students to join extracurriculars just as they require them to take core classes. This is because it gives students a chance to bond with others, become more involved in their school, and be a part of something that they would enjoy."
"Students shouldn't dread school, and this is one way to make it better. "
"In the age of technology, the questioning of seemingly 'old' systems and institutions has become common for better or for worse. Many schools offer online classes, or distance learning, as an option for those who are unable to take the course in-class. However, should the in-class education system be questioned simply because it is possible online? Education in schools physically is extremely important for the purpose of social development, preparation for the future, and for the availability of activities and resources."
"Social development is necessary for a person to function well in society; this cannot be fostered online as it requires face-to-face communication and interaction. In Psychology, Erik Erickson, a developmental psychologist, established the Stages of Development, a chart which describes essential stages during the life of every person. Any disruption to these stages can result in a hindering of social abilities or abilities to understand oneself. Online schooling would disrupt many of these stages as many correlate to community and friendship; something that would be difficult to find for many, especially those who are young. Additionally, Behavioral Psychologists have proven that people learn through observation, especially at a young age. In order for positive learning to occur, however, a relationship, such as a close friend, parent, or teacher, is very important. Online, especially for elementary age students, fun activities that appeal to their curiosity are far more difficult to find; but in school, a child has the ability to reach their full potential, learning with friends and working in groups. A disruption to a developmental stage or to observational learning could have a devastating domino effect on a student, preventing them from finding great success."
"In addition, attending classes in school is very beneficial in preparing students for the future. While some may argue that distance learning allows for more concentration, this is not necessarily true. In-class education gives students a glimpse into the reality of work; it allows students to learn and work in conditions that they will likely be in the future. Understanding others through group projects and adapting to challenges in work allows a student to be prepared for concentration in many environments. Also, online education allows students to cheat much more easily with search engines, such as Google. This problem, although found in schools, is far more prevalent online as there is no teacher to see the cheating. Some may also argue that online schooling encourages students to do their own planning; however, this is not any different from students who attend in school. In schools, students are held to the same standard as online students in regard to assignments, but the punishment for neglecting to turn in an assignment on time must be faced in person, which is far more harsh and realistic to the future. Therefore, in class education encourages students to take responsibility and ownership of their mistakes."
"Finally, in school education allows students to pursue new activities and resources that may not have otherwise been found. Throughout classroom schooling, activities that may seem unimportant to some are in fact extremely important. For example, the arts and PE--activities which could not be required and/or resourced at home--build thinking skills, kinesthetic skills, and stronger group relationships. Additionally, resources for the future, such as college planning and SAT preparation, may be difficult to find at home, but in schools, a counselor can help a student plan for such things. This is extremely important as it ensures that hard work is positively used in leading a student towards his or her goals."
"Online education, or distance learning, is not beneficial for students. Social development is not fostered in an online learning setting, thereby causing negative effects on the student, especially if the student is a child. In addition, students are not prepared for the future in distance learning as they are not fully held accountable for their mistakes and creates an unrealistic environment for work. Finally, without attending a school, activities and resources are lost, causing students to have less possibility for success and the pursuing of activities that give them joy. "
"In the passage, the author talks about the use of car usage. In my opinion, I think that we use cars to get place like, school, work, the store, to sporting events, to doctor's appointments. We use cars every day. Teenagers can drive because they need to know how to get places without relying on someone else to do it for them. Banging able to drive helps people a lot. It may not seem like it, but, every day someone gets injured in an automobile accident. We the people have the right to drive when we can."
"The Environment Protection Agency (EPA) is promoting ""car reduced"" places, and the legislators are starting to become a part of that. Many companies like that do it a lot. Just do what ever they want we want. I think if you want to drive you can drive. There are some bad things that happen to people when they drive. Sometimes it is not even their fault. Of course, they go to court and try to get things settled. Usually the person how caused the accident wins the case because their lawyer makes stuff up to make the person that didn't cause the accident to make them look like the did. That's called ""Tampering with evidence"". Which is against the law."
"With the new cars coming out, like the cars that don't need gasoline, that don't need a key, the companies are trying to prove a point. Gasoline can cause serious damage to the world. It sends toxic waste in the air every time you hit the gas petal. That's why companies like Ford, Chevy, Jeep, Mersaidnces Bin, BMW, and many other companies. It is OK to drive around, but it can be harmful and dangerous. One of my favorite bands Black Veil Brides, they use an electric tour bus because they don't want to harm the people, and it saves a lot of money. They love the people in the world, and they want them to be safe. You can pay up to $2.75 for a gallon of gasoline and $3.75 for diesel."
"Not everything in this ""country"" is gone for your health. Gasoline can kill people just by smelling it. It is highly flammable. If you are one a bus, and you start smelling something weird like diesel or gasoline, it would be smart to go to the driver and tell them because if you don't a lot of people can get hurt just by you not speaking up and telling him/her. Even through you didn't put the gas in the bus, you can still get sued because you didn't tell them. People die every day because of stupid stuff like this. Even on a plane. You smell diesel, you go to one of the flight adherents and tell them. They are required to tell the pilot what is happening, and must can their airport. Just telling someone that you steel it, you can save a lot of people."
"Just because cars can be dangerous, it doesn't mean that you can't speak up for what you believe in about it. Family loose loved ones because of drunk drives, texting, not paying attention to the road, and, not wearing their seatbelt. People make stupid and careless mistakes every day. People don't understand that. People don't care. It's your choice. You make the detention. Be a smart person, and you make your own choice. If your car usage is dangerous like driving an AMT on a highway, you're going to jail. Driving a car with a subinbuted drivers lie sense, you are going to lose your car. It's up to you. That's all I have to say."
"We've all heard Nike's catchphrase slogan is"" "
"Just Do It, "" but not everyone feels it's that simple. Some students may need a little nudge because they are afraid or nervous to try new things. All students should have to participate in at least one extracurricular activity because it will look good on applications, is a good use of students' time, and it will teach them valuable traits."
"Participating in extracurricular activities will look good on college and job applications because it will show you're not afraid to try new things even if you're not amazing at them in the beginning. Trying new things can seem scary at first, but it's always good to push past the anxiety and just do it."
"Secondly, when colleges see all the clubs and teams you've joined, they'll see that you have multiple skills. When they see that, you'll have a better shot at being picked because they will most likely want someone who is well-rounded, rather than someone who's only skill is drawing lopsided circles."
"Lastly, if one of the extracurriculars you participated in relates to a job you're going out for, and you list it on your application, you might seem like a better fit for the position since you've already had experience in that area. Like if you took a culinary class and later applied to Chick-fil-A, you'd seen more qualified since you've already done something with food."
"All lot of students don't realize it now, but the classes you take in high school, especially, can actually affect your future."
"Being on a team can help build positive traits in students. For starters, they will learn the value of team work and how to collaborate with others and how to communicate with their teammates in a way that is calm and clear. Learning how to work well with others is an extremely useful skill that will take you much farther in life than just middle or high school."
"Additionally, students will learn the responsibility of how to carry ones own weight and do they're part to not only try their hardest, but also to work in a way that reflects well on their teammates. Gaining this notion of responsibility will help in school for doing group projects, later on in life at work for doing your tasks efficiently and well, at home for doing your chores so that your home can run smoothly, and so much more."
"Thirdly, students will learn the importance of persevering through the difficult times and that just because things aren't going the way you want them to at the moment, doesn't mean you should just give up. Rejection and failure are, unfortunately, a big part of life that aren't going to be leaving anytime soon. You'll get knocked down and around a lot in this lifetime, the important thing is how you get back up."
"Responsibility, teamwork, and perseverance are great things to learn, but there's also so much more you can gain from doing extracurriculars, if you want to know, go try an extracurricular yourself."
"Some people might say doing extracurricular activities is a waste of time and will only distract students from their studies. However, this is not always the case. Not all extracurricular activities happen after school, some are actual classes that happen during regular school hours. Since this is true, it's also true that taking an extracurricular will give students an opportunity to learn about things they are interested in without, in fact, wasting their time."
"In conclusion, all students should have to participate in at least one extracurricular activity because participating in extracurricular activities looks good on college applications, can teach student's valuable traits, and is a good use of students' time. Not everyone is always willing to try new things on their own, but in taking an extracurricular they aren't alone, chances are, half the people there are trying something new right along with you.  "
Dear Principle
"They rule on phones and other devices are very strict, I agree 100% with ""Policy 1"" I truly think it's the best policy for us students. First reason is that its true during class we shouldn't be texting but when we are at lunch I think we should be allowed to text with our friends, I also think we should be able to while not busy like sometimes in advisory or assemblies you know stuff like that."
"Now about ""Policy 2"" I completely disagree because us students need our phone for whatever reason. Not having it at school at all is a bad idea, what if we have an emergency, and we need to call our parents or friends after no matter what reason or problem we have. If we ever get our phone taken up we have to pay $15 I think that's a little over board just to get your phone back. So once again I have to totally agree with"" Policy 1"" it's the least they can do for us and the policy is the most reasonable for me and every other student in the school. so I think every single school in the district or even the nation should have this policy."
Sincerely: Your student
"Would it be a good idea to use technology such as computers to read students emotional expressions. Some people would argue that it is not a good idea because what if some students don't want the computer to tell what the felling, they would think it was a little weird. I think that it would be a good idea here is why."
"I think it would be a good I dead for computers to read students emotional expressions. Furthermore, I think this because say if somebody is falling be hind in class and the computer can tell. The computer could change the chapter or less he or she is confused with, so they could understand it better. The student would no longer be confused and could catch up."
"Some people would say that what if the computer thinks the kid doesn't understand the material that he or she is learning. The computer would change the lesson up a little, so they could understand it better, but in the long run doesn't. In that case the computer would make it harder for that particular student to learn the material given to them."
Some students would like it because it would help them in away that makes them understand the lesson or chapter better witch also would help there grade. If I had the chance to use this technology I would.
Sometimes I am a little lost or confused and if you don't get that lesson you could fall farther and further in the hole. And never catch up. With this technology u would never fall behind.
With all the information we have the technology could either help out a student or make them fall behind. The information we have concludes that we would still be better of we the technology. So not so many people are falling behind and getting confused. You would be able to keep up with your class and not get lost. This is what I think about having this technology to read students emotional expressions.
"Some schools were considering doing classes from home like online or video conferencing. This could change schools Heavily. Having the options to take classes at home would not benefit students because they don't need to pay attention they could put up the class and just walk away, and also it would make it so many students would skip school all the time."
"Having the option to take classes at home would not benefit the students because they wouldn't even have to pay attention. The main point of school is to educate kids and prepare them for adulthood, but how can Schools assure they are learning if someone isn't there to make sure there actually paying attention. Many teachers will make sure students are not on their phone and are actually paying attention but no one can assure that if the kids are at home. Finally, if students didn't understand they would have no way of asking questions."
"Next if students could simply take their classes from home some students wouldn't ever go to school. If students were just skipping school and taking their classes online many students would not graduate. Doing this would just give students another reason to try and skip school daily. School is more than just learning information It's also about learning important skills for life like responsibility, teamwork, and problem-solving. Being able to take classes at home would make it impossible for some students to learn those skills."
Some people may say that having the option to take classes at home would benefit the students because it would give an option for kids who couldn't attend school that day to not fall behind. Many kids will get sick throughout the year or have a reason not to come to school and this would give them a chance to not fall behind.
"Giving students the option to take classes at home would not benefit them at all because it would make it, so kids could just skip school whenever they want and just because they have the class on the computer doesn't mean they are actually paying attention."
"Finally, In order for the students TP truly benefit they would need to really want to learn."
"Dear State Senator,"
"Changing to election by popular vote for the President of the United States would be a better choice. Keeping Electoral College to me would mean a crash in the system. Also, when you vote you would not be voting for the president, but for a State of Electors, who in turn elect the president. In my opinion is one of these elections the Electoral College systems would crash due to the State Legislatures are responsible for picking the electors and those electors could always defy the will of the people. Plus the State of Electors have too much power that's horrible, because if the State of Electors where to decide on another candidate there vote would count more than the people. Which would lead to the people to get angry because you voted, and many others voted for the same one, but it all comes down too what the State of Electors say. I'm not the only one that has this opinion. According to the Gallup poll on 2000, taken shortly after Al Gore, won the popular vote but lost the presidency. Over 60 percent of the voters would prefer a direct election to the kind we have known. All we need State Senator is a good system because eventually this system that we have right now will eventually crash.  "
Limiting car usage is not bad at all! It benefits everyone in a specific way.
"As stated in the article carefree cities Source 1: Harm Walter, a media trainer and mother two quotes ""When I had a car I was always tense. I'm much happier this way"" Harm being a mother two you can only imagine the car trips she would have to make. Going place to place can cause a lot of stress to some people, and it makes it harder for them to drive. For example, someone could be stressed to the max with all the traffic and driving around that it could create accidents along the way. No one should ever feel stressed while driving. Driving should be a privilege and good one."
"In Paris, they have banned driving due to smog. Diesel fuel was blamed since France has tax policy that favors diesel over gasoline. Diesels make up 67 percent of vehicles in France, compared to a 53.3 percent average of diesel engines in the rest of Western Europe. Paris has more smog than other European capitals. Paris had 147 micrograms of particulate matter per cubic meter compared with 114 in Brussels and 79.7 in London. Certain things like this can help save the environment without the usage of vehicles."
"With no car usage it prevents teens from getting into accidents and or drunk driving. The safer way to go is to walk or stay with a friend somewhere safe than being on the road. Many accidents could be prevented but it won't if limiting the car usage is not available. Death rates will decrease, and many people will be safer this way. A study last year found that driving by young people decreased by 23 percent between 2001 and 2009. Without transportation many young people could make other main priorities. For example, they could organize their summer jobs and social life around where they can walk or take public transportation or carpool with friends."
"Up above, I have given my reasons why we should all limit car usage. It would relieve stress from on the road, saves the environment and takes the smog away, and young people would be more socialize and up for doing more than what they already do like jobs."
"As students get older they start not wanting to go to school so, some schools started offering online video conferencing as an alternative for this problem. Therefore, some might say that video online conferencing would help students because they can learn from home. But, students would not actually benefit from online video conferencing because the lack of physical interaction and the distractions at home."
"If students started to do online video conferencing, they would lack physical interaction. Some people might think that this is great for the shy students. But, if the teacher is not present the students wouldn't ask questions and the teacher wouldn't be able to physically help them with a problem. Also, the students wouldn't have one on one time with the teacher. Students need one on one time with the teacher, so they can understand what they are learning and so that the teacher can help them individually. Furthermore, students need hands on learning. Hands on learning is important because it gives the students a general idea what the actual work is like, so they can learn it and understand it better."
"Additionally, students would be distracted by the activities and objects at home. Students would not pay attention to what they are learning if they are on their phones. Student are always on their phones, they text and check social media every day. The teacher would not be able to punish them if they are on their phones during a lecture or while the teacher is teaching a lesson because the student is not physically there. The students would also be distracted by their parents. Their parents could be a distraction by interrupting the student while in a lesson. The parents could ask the student to do chores like: take out the trash, do the dishes, or even take the dog on a walk. Furthermore, students would get distracted by their pets. Pets are very unpredictable so, the student doesn't know what the pet is going to do. The pet could make a mess or just be really noisy. Pets would take the attention away from the lesson the teacher is trying to teach."
Students shouldn't start doing online video conferencing. Students should go to school and have physical interactions with other students and teachers with fewer distractions. Schools should step into another direction to make students want to go to school again. The Department of Education should act now to bring students to their facilities.
Some rezones to join the program are that you can help people after they have had a hard time. The situation from the text is after World War ll there was a lot of destruction in Europe. So Luke went over to Europe to help people get their lives back. Being a Seagoing Cowboy wasn't all just work you also got to travel the world and see cool places. He said that he and other people on the boat had fun on the way back.
"He said that he saw some cool places, and did cool thing, like seeing the Panama Canal or go on a gondola ride in Vance, Italy. The the stalls were empty, he said, that a lot of guys on the ship would play games to make the time pass. Some of the games that he had mentioned were baseball, volleyball, table tennis, and many others. They helped pass the time by playing games, is what he said."
"I think that he made it sound very appealing to be a Seagoing Cowboy it definitely had it's up's a down's. Like cleaning the stars would be a down, and an up would be playing games. Also being able to go see and do things in other parts of the world.  "
"Author Ralph Waldo Emerson once said, ""Success isn't around the corner. You'll have to work as hard as you can until you reached your limits. Always trying new things will make you grow."" Life can be great, if you know how to make the best out of it. Although, it may seem that trying is hard, and it's a waste of time, it is actually true that trying can make you achieve your goals."
"Trying my hardest showed me who I really am. I accomplished some of my goals, but I always try to be inspired. This helped me get through my problems. None of my goals have been easy, they're hard, but that doesn't stop me. My plan is to be successful in life and not to be a failure. Sometimes I loose and sometimes I win."
"I used to be 275 pounds, I wasn't happy with the way I looked. I also experience random pain in my heart. My body was telling me to start losing weight. I really wanted to go and loose all of my weight, but my lazy side said to just sit in the couch and play video games all day. I had to get my life together and started going to the gym, the following day. Day by day, I started to feel something different. I felt more energetic and strong. I ate healthy, and those heart pains were gone. My parents were always there for me to encourage me. I also wanted to be an example to my little brother that anything is possible, as long as you try."
"I lost 58 pounds to be exact. Furthermore, I feel lighter than ever. Furthermore, I went beyond my limits to accomplish my goal. All hard work always rewards you as it did for me. My reward was having cheat days. I always love cheat days because you can forget about your diet for a day and eat whatever you want. Cheat days are the best to have, but not all the time. You can lose track and fall."
"Accomplishments are hard to achieve, but it's a lot of fun to do them. They can make you a better person and makes your life so much easier. As long as you try your best, you can do anything. My grandpa told me that trying is your best buddy. It can make you push yourself, and it can take you places you've never seen in your life."
"Venus, the second planet from the sun, has long been known as a desolate, barren, and hostile environment. Venus is devoid of any potential to support humans for the next several million years. Long story short, both manned and unmanned missions to Venus are expensive, time-consuming, and provide no meaningful information that can't already be determined from earth, or a low-orbit probe."
"The author presents the feat of missions to Venus as a ""challenge"", and rightfully so."
"Paragraph 3 provides plenty of reasons to keep away from the second planet. The surface of this inhospitable rock is plagued with crushing atmospheric pressure, temperatures of more than 800 degrees, and highly corrosive clouds of sulfuric acid vapor."
"""The challenge"" isn't much of a reason to toss away millions of dollars of research, no matter how large of a rush it gives humanity. The author also mentioned the value of scientific research conducted on our neighbor planet. Except, in paragraph 6, they outright state, ""peering at Venus from a ship orbiting or hovering safely above the ground can provide only limited insight on ground conditions""."
"Finally, an analysis of paragraph 7 doesn't give us any information that we weren't already aware of. Except, an interesting point was made. Using older, mechanical devices to take the place of electronic ones could negate the issues imposed by fragile silicon chips. Mechanical machines still need power, provided by batteries or solar panels, which are controlled by computers. A mechanical computer has just as many, if not more potential issues than an electronic one."
"This article is fun to read, and is an excellent source of information about the planet Venus, but the author struggles to find valid reasons to go there. This article is a fluff piece, a feel-good piece of writing. If I were to create a similar writing, I would include more appeals to logic. ""The Challenge of Exploring Venus"" would have been far more appealing to me had it included more actual reasons to venture to a mysterious planet. ""For Science!"" just isn't sufficient in this particular case."
"Hey there, it is Luke. And I am asking you to join the Seagoing Cowboys. We are running out of people and would really enjoy some more help with the program. I would believe that you would really like this program, you would have the opportunities of a lifetime! Yourself and many others on the ship would be able to see and explore places that you can only think of."
"Are you starting to like the idea of it now? Well I am almost sure that you would love it even more if you were on the ship right now! Especially if you are a big animal lover why, you might as well hop on right now. Here in the Seagoing Cowboys program there are lots of animals that you can never get tired of! And I know what you are thinking, you are probably thinking about your family and how much you are going to miss them. I know, that is what I thought about to before I myself joined the Seagoing Cowboys program. But, you really have to think about this. You would be missing out on an adventure of a lifetime! And I think your family would understand if you were leaving to help people around the world. Mine did! And see some very, very cool things while you are out there. After all there is a world out there, and you are just waiting to see it."
"Now maybe you could at least consider being a part of the Seagoing Cowboys program? I mean, I love it, and you could too! Maybe you could even pass this note around? Why not ask some close friends and family or some people you know if they might want to join the program too! I think they would love it! Well, maybe you could get back to me about this. And I hope that I can see you soon!"
"""Hi"", I am Luke Merger."
"I am a Seagoing Cowboy a part of the ""Seagoing Cowboys"" from the UNRWA"
(the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration.)
"I was not always a Seagoing Cowboy, I was actually a regular boy just graduating from high school and working two part-time jobs one in a grocery store and the other at a bank."
"I was doing just fine, until my friend Don Last invited me to go to Europe on a cattle boat, I couldn't say no, and he said it was an opportunity of a lifetime so, I said, ""What the heck, I'll go"" and that's the beginning of how my life changed."
"It was in August in 1945, when I went on my first adventure as a Seagoing cowboy, I just arrived on August 14, when the Pacific War ended and me and Don got our seaman's papers and boarded the SS Charles W. Wooster and headed for Greece-with a cargo of 335 horses plus enough hay for us to feed them."
"The next day I turned 18 before arriving in Greece and I realized that I could be drafted for military service, so instead I drafted myself and by the time it was 1947, I had made nine trips-the most of any Seagoing Cowboy, I helped many people while stopping, but most importantly I hope that you can also help people just how me and Don did."
"So, in conclusion, just become a Seagoing Cowboy, because it opened the world up to me and gave me a grateful opportunity, and It can make you more aware of people of other countries and their needs."
"The author describes that they a computer that can tell then you are mad or sad i don't think that this a good think because then u going to see everyone how they really feel and i don't like people knowing how I feel and what I be doing so if this was me, and we had that think that can tells our feelings I would not like it base like is aide i don't like people knowing hoe I feel only my family. And I would tell if you are happy or not the man that tried to do this was really created to do this but there's a lot of people that don't like to tell people how they feel and what's going onion there houses and they just mead something that can tell how you are feeling your home PC can't handle complex algorithms used to decode money lists smile but e can write down some simple instructions that encode different emotions so the first people IR picture was the picture if the Mona Lisa to see if shoots really scaling in the picture or no. and they said that they have seen her eyes and in the picture they saw that she was trying to sailing and in the camera 3D they have seen that she was trying to small and to me Mona Lisa she looks like she was trying to Conrad but she didn't show it a lot. This is what I think in the picture of Mona Lisa."
"Imagine it's a bright, sunny day. A family decides they want to go to the park. I know you're thinking, ""OK. Then they'll get in the car and go"", but this family doesn't get into a car. This family rides their bikes to the park and sometimes even walks. Matter of a fact all of their neighbors are doing the same. Many cities are now car-free and are enjoying every bit of it."
"In Vauban, Germany, the residents have given up their cars and gone for a more pioneer lifestyle. In source 1 it says, ""Street parking, driveways and home garages are generally forbidden in this experimental new district."" Car ownership is allowed, but there are only two places available for parking-large garages, where a car-owner buys a space, for $40,000, along with a home. 70 percent of Vauban's families do not own cars, and the 57 percent sold a car to move there. Hadron Walter, a media trainer and mother of two says,"" When I had a car I was always tense. I'm much happier this way."" When walking down streets, the swish of bicycles and the chatter of children drown out the occasional distant motor."
"In Paris, France, there recently has been days of near-record pollution, so they enforced a partial driving ban to clear the air. Motorists were offered to leave their cars at home or pay a fine of 22-euro ($31), almost 4,000 drivers were fined and many had their cars impounded for their reaction to the fine. Diesel fell was blamed for intensifying smog, since France has a tax policy that favors diesel over gasoline. In source 2 it says, ""Diesels make up 67 percent of vehicles in France, compared to a 53.3 percent average of detail engines in the rest of Western Europe."" The smog, soon enough, cleared up and the ruling French party rescinded the ban for odd-numbered plates."
"In Bogotá, Columbia, there is now a car-free day when millions of Colombians hiked, biked, skated, or took buses to work leaving the streets eerily devoid of traffic jams. This has been the third year straight where cars have been banned with only buses and taxis permitted for the Day Without Cars. Businessman Carlos Arturo Plaza says, ""It's a good opportunity to take away stress and lower air pollution."" Parks and sports centers have bloomed throughout the city. Uneven, pitted sidewalks have been replaced by smooth sidewalks. Rush-hour restrictions have dramatically cut traffic, and new restaurants and upscale shopping districts have cropped up."
"In conclusion, it seems that residents in car-free cities are more stress-free, happy, and taking care of air pollution. These advantages of limiting car usage should appeal to a lot of different countries now. I'm not saying we should ban cars all together, (because I really enjoy driving), but maybe just cut down on it and enjoy the outdoors for once.  "
"Dear Principle,"
I have heard of your new policy change and I agree with you. Many students work hard to maintain a B average and I think other students should have to work as hard to play sports. The new policy change would be good for students and their learning skills. The grade point average of students would be much better and help them in the future. The policy to have a B average to play sports may also inspire students to do better in other things outside of school such as volunteering or helping the community in other ways. This policy change will be good in the long run and can help students learn responsibility and I feel there is nothing wrong with that. Thank you for taking the time to read this letter and I hope you agree with what I have to say about the new policy.
"Sincerely,"

"Summer would be a lot of fun if students were able to design their own projects. Some schools require students to complete summer projects to assure they continue learning during their break. One may argue that summer projects should be teacher-designed. However, summer projects should be student-designed because, students will learn more, students will feel accomplished, and lastly students will be prepared for life as adults. Students will enjoy their summer and their projects if they were allowed to design it."
"Students will learn more from their projects if they designed it! They would put more thought into their projects which expands their learning. A lot of thought goes into designing a project. Students will have to plan out and organize their projects, which takes a lot of learning! Students will learn more from working, on a project, on something that interests them. There is way more excitement and joy on learning when it is something in their interest. Rather than doing a topic a teacher wants students to do, students should be allowed to do a topic in their interest. Learning should not always be hard. These summer projects would be easier for students do on a topic they enjoy learning about! Students will enjoy learning more If summer projects are student-designed."
"There is nothing better than seeing a student feeling accomplished on a project they designed. Students will feel accomplished on their work. It will boost up their self-esteem. They will have more confidence knowing they designed that whole project on their own. Students will take pride in their work. Students will be proud of themselves, not only will students be proud but parents, and teachers will also be proud!"
Students will also feel motivated to continue outstanding work just like that on any other projects in the future. It is a great feeling to have students feeling accomplished in their work and not just something a teacher designed for them. Students will feel as if they can do anything!
"Student-designed projects will prepare them for the real world as adults! As a teacher, their goals should always be to prepare students for adulthood! Students will be challenged to think outside the box for their projects. The fact that the project is student-designed will push students to be creative with their projects, and also its gives them a challenge. Students will also learn how to be under a little pressure. Designing a whole project takes a ton a work and will have students under a little pressure. It will defiantly be good practice for the future in their careers. Students will learn how to plan and organize things on their own. While designing a project, there will be planning and organizing that comes with it. Which also prepares them for the future. In life there will be a lot of obstacles which includes lots of planning and organizing. From their projects they gain a lot of practice and tips that may help in the future. Students earn way more than just a good grade, They gain lots of knowledge that may help for adulthood."
"In conclusion, students gain much more than just a high five or a pat on the back from designing their own projects. Some schools require students to complete summer projects to assure they continue learning during their break. One may argue that summer projects should be teacher-designed. Summer projects should be student-designed because, students will learn more, students will feel accomplished, and lastly students will be prepared for life as adults. Students deserve the chance to show out their skills and show what they can bring to the table! There is a lot a student can show teachers just need to allow them to express themselves. Students will enjoy their summer and their projects if they were allowed to design it."
"In American society today- and other countries also-it's safe to say that only a little more than half of teenagers are wanting to get their driver's license. It is the same way with adults too. More people are choosing to move to smaller communities where shopping centers and restaurants are a walking distance away. At first, it was all about just following the trend or a new law. Now people are realizing that not driving everywhere is beneficial in more than one way."
"In Europe, this trend is growing rapidly and has been for a few years now. Countries like Germany, Race and Switzerland are examples of where a large percentage of their population don't drive cars. In Vauban, Germany it is against the law to park anywhere except for parking garages and if the car-owner purchases their own parking space, with a home also, for $40,000. ""As a result, 70 percent of Vauban's families do not own cars, and 57 percent sold a car to move here."" (""In German Suburb, Life Goes On Without Cars"" P3). Greenhouse gas emissions are produced from 12% of car-owners in Europe. With fewer cars, it is said there the city has a less tense and/or stressful vibe to it, and the pollution level has decreased dramatically."
"In America, the love for cars is not as strong anymore either. In April 2013 the number of miles driven per person was 9% lower than it was in January 1995, and 23% of people weren't driving between the years of 2001-2009. ""In the United States, the Environmental Protection Agency is promoting 'car reduced' communities, and legislators are starting to act, if cautiously."" (""In German Suburb, Life Goes On Without Cars"" P9). Though reducing the amount of cars being driven has a positive impact on the environment, it will have a negative impact on car industries across the U.S."
"Paris, France and Bogotá, Columbia have proved that having less car-owners has decreased pollution levels. In Bogotá, there is a Day Without Cars where only public transportation is allowed. Citizens will suffer a $25 fine if they are driving their own car. Paris, France temporarily banned driving, and if they were found driving a 22-euro fine was charged. Both countries saw immediate results in the amount of smog in that cities."
"It is obvious that not owning a car or choosing to walk more than driving has effected places like Europe, America and South America positively. As more people realize that limiting car usage is good for the environment and beneficial to their everyday lives, fewer people will be driving, and the world will slowly see start to see a change.  "
Would you like to be able to not drive you car or to drive your car? I would like to have driveless cars. Can you imagine the time that you get into to your car and the only thing you have to do is say car start? Well that where are cars are transforming into we are starting to get cars that we don't have to drive the cars drive for us.
"Driverless cars well also help the driver. In the text it says"" they still alert driver to take over when pulling in and out of driveways or dealing with complicated traffic issues, such as navigating through roadwork accidents."" So the driverless car well also let the driver know when to take over manually by vibration of the seat. So the driver well always have to be aware of what's going on. Driverless cars well also get you to where you're going in the shortest amount of time possible."
"I think if we have self-driving cars there won't be as many car crashes as there have been in the past couple of years. From people texting and driving or driving drunk or stuff like that. In paragraph 7 the text says'' They can steer, accelerate, and brake themselves."" So if the drivers are careless and not paying attention to the road like there text or something the care can stop for them and not cause a crash."
"That's why I agree with the idea of a driverless car. I can see why some people wouldn't want a driverless car because what if the car crashes or something went wrong with it, you might be the one responsible for the car crashing. So I can see why they might not want a driverless car. I think that driverless cars well be a good thing to have in 2020"
Phones & Driving
"Driving while engaged in any activity that could divert a person's attention away from the primary task of driving. When drivers read or send a text message, their reaction time is doubled. When asked to respond to a flashing light while texting behind the wheel, drivers were more than 11 times more likely to miss the light altogether. In the United States, automobile crashes due to distracted driving are increasing. The leading cause of distracted driving is cell phones In 2015, six hundred and sixty thousand drivers in the United States were estimated to use cell phones each day, while driving behind the wheel during daylight hours. Cell phone use while driving has become a leading cause of vehicle crashes over the last two decades. Using a cell phone while driving increases the driver's risk of causing a crash. Drivers are distracted, decreasing the driver's awareness on the road, leading to more car crashes. When drivers talk on cell phones the risk of an automobile crash resulting in hospitalization is four times higher than when not talking on a cell phone. Drivers who text when behind the wheel, are twenty-three times more likely to have an automobile crash. One out of every four automobile crashes in the United States are caused by texting while driving. Some states have implemented laws in regard to using cell phones while driving, there is more to be done. Driving while using a hands free cellular device is not safer than using a hand held cell phone, as concluded by case-crossover studies, epidemiological, simulation, and meta-analysis. The increased cognitive workload involved in holding a conversation, not the use of hands, causes the increased risk.  "
"Teachers exclusively should design summer assignments to apply tools and characteristics Jessica to review or learn in the upcoming year. This will not only educate students what they need to review, but also the new expectations and allow them a preview on the types of assignments the individual teacher assigns. Summer assignments should be teacher designed to educate students on what is to be expected in the following year."
"Over the summer, students have a tendency to forget information they learned in the past year(s). Summer assignments allow for students to still have time off from school, but also insure they are still learning and not loosing information needed in their next school year. By making the project teacher designed, the educator can make sure the project is outlining previously taught tools, information, and possibly new skills they will need in their class in the fall; something that may potentially be missed or not fully applied if student design their own projects."
"Expectations and types of assignments/projects vary from teacher and year. The purpose of summer assignments should be not only to make sure students are still learning and retaining information, but to also give the student a preview of the teachers teaching/assignment style, level of difficulty of the class, and grading rubric. This way, it benefits the student in more way than one and completely prepares them for the class expectations of the following year. Therefore, it is essentially the teacher themselves designs the project for the benefit of the student in all such elements."
"Some may disagree that the individual student should design their own summer project because it insures the student is learning while getting some enjoyment and individuality. However, if the students themselves design the project, it is not guaranteed they will apply information and tools vital for next year. Even if they are given a rubric specifically outlining the Jessica elements needed within the project, the assignment will still be lacking an example of the types of projects the teacher is likely to assign in the future, the teachers educating style, and will not exhibit the true difficulty of the class. The student will still be able to show their personality through their work within the teacher designed project, so it will still display individuality; but at the same time preparing them for the teachers class specifically."
"Summer projects are helpful in the fact it assures students are still learning over break, but if exclusively the teacher designs it can simultaneously also be very helpful in outlining previously taught tools/ information they need in the following year, teacher and class expectations, as well as displaying both teacher and student personality. Summer assignments should be teacher designed to educate students on what is to be expected in the following year.  "
"Have you ever thought of having a car that could drive itself? It would be a pretty cool car to have, but there are some things you have to think about when you consider on buying a car. Of course the car is going to be expansive but what car isn't? There area lot more negative things you have to think about when buying a smart car. Negative aspects of a driveless are is that they are expensive, need many sensors, and they result in many accidents."
"A driveless car is very expansive because they have to know the roads, when to stop, how to stop, or when to go. It stated"" These smart-road-systems worked surprisingly well, but they required massive upgrades to existing roads, something that was simply too expensive to be practical."" Driverless cars work well, but they are too expensive because they have to know the upgrades of roads. Imagine the cost you have to pay for the car, giving them their money back for the money they spent and work they spent putting into the car. Sensors are a very big issues too in driveless cars."
"Driverless cars require many sensors in order for the car to work and drive on its own. It seems cool, but what will happen when one of those sensors stopped working and you didn't know? The sensors were placed everywhere in the car so it can work properly. ""Google's modified Toyota Prius uses position-estimating sensors on the left rear wheel, a rotating sensor on the roof, a video camera mounted near the rearview mirror, four automotive radar sensors, a GPS receiver, and an inertial motion sensor..."" There are a lot of sensors installed inside the car, but something can go very wrong if one of them stop working and the car crashes and injure somebody."
"Who fault would it be if someone is injured because of technology failure ? Driverless car are not reliable due to safety concerns. ""Manufactures believe that more states will follow as soon as the cars are proved more reliably safe... If the technology fails and someone is injured, who is at fault-the driver or the manufacturer?"" If someone is hurt because the technology of the car, you really can't say who to blame. Although the driver can take control of the car at any time so therefore the driver can be at fault because the driver wasn't paying attention to the road. The driveless car is supposed to make the driver aware of danger, but it couldn't have if there was an accident, so the car can be at fault to. No one really Knows who to blame because both the car and the driver took responsible for the accident and they both could have prevented the accident from happening. If the car had alerted the driver, the driver could have taken control BUT if the driver EAS paying attention, he could have once again took control."
"There are positive and negative aspects when it comes to driveless cars but of course no one pays attention to the negative. When thinking about purchasing a driveless car you have to think about the cost and your safety concerns. Driverless cars are very expensive because of the sensors that are installed and the upgrades to road. They are dangerous because due to technology failure they can result into car accidents. Expense, sensors, and accidents are negative aspect of driveless ares."
"I think you should go for the first school policy about phones. Students should be allowed to bring cell phones to school but only to be used during their free time. The reason why is that if you ban phones from the school than students might not really care, and they will just bring their cell phones anyway. On the other hand you should also warn that their cell phones could be brought in and used only in their free time. You can also warn that cell phones will be confiscated if students are found using them in class."
"The main reason is that they won't really care if cell phones are allowed, and you don't really do anything about it. The more this happens, the more they will get used to it. If cell phones are just banned then they will still do the same thing, only they will use them more often, behind the teachers' back. This is why you should allow them the freedom for cell phones to be used only in their freedom. That way they know when and what will happen if caught. Otherwise, they will continue to use phones in class if they are not confiscated until the end of class. If the phones were to be confiscated for a longer period of time, than maybe the students will start using them less and less often in class. The policy should have other things added in like for phones to be confiscated for long periods of time, consequences, and or like the contact of parents if caught using phones in class. This will not only get them in trouble in class but at home maybe, if not they will not learn. If they do manage to realize, then they will do better in the future or think better of the consequences."
Basically you should allow cell phones but with not so many heavy punishments that they will continue their previous acts without caring. You should still have consequences and warn students of confiscation for long periods of time. This might make them use phones only during recess or lunch or other free times available to them. In the time being of the confiscation they will think better of their actions and therefore act better of it.
"Author Ralph Waldo Emerson wrote,''to be yourself in a world that is constantly trying to make you something else is the greatest accomplishment''. Although some people disagree about Emerson's statement, actually I agree because society is always trying to make people change their point of view, their culture, their believers. First never give up, Second always love and be proud of yourself and Third don't forgot your roots."
"Here are some reasons why I agree with Emerson's statement. First, the world is trying to make change, but you have to never have to give up. Because it's important to continue being yourself, not matter if some people are not going to like it, the only one who have to feel comfortable with yourself it's you. Second, always love and be proud of yourself. It's important to be proud of who you are because even though you make mistakes sometimes that doesn't have to make change who you are. You just have to learn from your mistakes, I know it is difficult but no one says that would be easy, but you can do it. Love yourself because every of your features, your character and your personality is what identify you, is make you unique, different from anyone else in the world that wants you to fit on it. Third, don't forgot your roots. If you are from another country you are forced to change yourself, trying to pretend that you are something else, but you must have to stop it. Because in a world that is constantly trying to make you be something else your biggest accomplishment is to show that you are better than what they expected you to be."
"Finally, what are you waiting for!. Don't let the world change yourself, remember to never give up always fight for is better for you, love and be proud of yourself always and don't forget your roots because every part of yourself is what make you unique, special and that is your greatest accomplishment."
"Some schools offer education at home, online, and or video conference calls. Teachers and some students believe that off campus is horrible. The reason why is : you won't have an actual human teaching you with online classes, Video conference calls aren't great because most people aren't paying any attention to the teachers or student also you would need more assistance which is just unnecessary. Then finally you won't meet any people, and you won't learn how to socialize at the end you won't learn how speak to people."
"The school that offers these programs should just destroy these programs. Students should learn to how to go to school. Learn how to make friends, teachers,also day-to-day people. Just go get an education which is very important thing to do and that needs to happen if you want to do anything for the future the place they should just get an education is on an on campus school."
"To the schools that offer the out of school education some that are at home, online,and video calls. Teachers and a lot of surveys show that having students without of school education tend to have lower grades, more missing assignments, and fewer people in their lives. The facts just show that if you aren't at an on campus school,Your grades tend to be way lower than the average student on campus student. If you don't go to on campus schooling you will become social awkward. It's not fun staying home"
"With the online classes these days it has some benefits but the end of the day it's still a very bad distraction usual for example people love to watch television while doing work, but they aren't doing the assignment with 100 percent attention. If you want to get something done do it the right way. Also, with the student they have many ways to cheat with any kind of education that's not on an on campus school cheating is 100 percent wrong not the right thing to do. Studies show that if you have two or more things that you are doing you are doing at the same time they aren't using there whole brain to do they're work. One of the major reason why online classes aren't good because you can just google the answers that's just cheating you aren't learning its cheating."
"Video Conference calls are just a waste of time. Students don't listen or even look at the screen to the call. It's just better and useful if you went to school. Just go to school you won't have to do calls and extra things like calling over and over again. Also, it teaches you not to be lazy. If you go to school you wouldn't need to call or anything of the sort just go to school and get an education."
"The school should destroy these programs and students need to go to an on campus school education, or they won't be able to anything for the future for there education because they didn't pay attention or learn it well plus they won't have any friends to know them."
In conclusion students should be able to go to an on campus school just like the rest of us and meet new people and friends for the future.  
"This technology to read the emotional expressions of students in a classroom is valuable because what if you want to joke around with a friend you don't know if they're sad. If they're sad then you can make them laugh. It would be great if classrooms had this technology because in paragraph 6 sentence 5 it says ""A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored"", it could show the teachers how to help the students learn the subject without making them bored or confused. In paragraph 6 sentence 6 it says ""Then it could modify the lesson, like an effective human instructor"", what it's trying to say is that it could make the lesson more interesting than what a human normally would do."
"My first reason to why classrooms should have the technology to read students emotions is because the technology can tell you how the student is feeling. The technology has six basic emotions, and they are happiness, surprise anger, disgust, fear, and sadness. In paragraph 4 sentence 3 it says ""The software can even identify mixed emotions."""
"My second reason is that the technology even told us the emotions of Mona Lisa. You're probably asking ""how if Mona Lisa is just a painting?"" well that's what I said. In paragraph 4 sentence 3 it says ""using video imagery, the emotion-recognition software tracks these facial movements in a real face or in the painted face of Mona Lisa"". In paragraph 8 sentence 3 it says ""to an expert, faces don't lie; these muscles clues are sometimes used to spot when a ""smiling"" politician or celebrity isn't being truthful."
"All around the world countries are making an effort to reduce their use of cars to benefit the Earth. There are many benefits to reducing car usage all around the world. Not only does it reduce solution, but it also promotes getting out and being active. Vauban, Germany is a car-free community where the voices of a few children can drown out the hum of a car. Bogotá, Colombia has established a program called the Day Without Cars where they promote alternate transportation and reduce smog. This promotes people to use transportation that runs on man-power like bikes or even walking. This also falls into the fact that as people use bikes and walk they begin to get more exercise. Although most of the time it is more continent to use cars to get to a location some places have stores within walking distance, so there would be no need for the use of a car."
"Pollution has been a problem around the world for many years, each country is responsible for their own share of polluting the Earth and cars are part of the problem. Cars alone are responsible for 50 percent of greenhouse emissions in America, if Americans made an effort to reduce that number by just half it would mean a world of difference to that country. It would result in America being less responsible for the pollution of the Earth and a safer environment for the citizens. However, other countries have been taking action to help the environment, efforts were thrown towards cities to make it more beneficial to walk, and they are now setting their sights on suburbs. Vauban, Germany is community where there is an advanced experiment that focuses on eliminating the use of cars. Their efforts have proven quite successful as only 30 percent of the families that live their own cars and almost 60 percent of the residents sold their car in order to live there. Bogotá, Colombia has created a day when everyone is encouraged to use bikes and walk instead of using fuel-burning cars, those who chose not to participate in this event were fined $25. The effort that was put into the making of this event has inspired other countries like Cali and Valledupar to do the same. This shows that people are making an effort to move towards environmentally beneficial habits that cause a chain reaction."
"Another benefit to reducing the use of cars is that people will get more exercise than they usually do. For some people the most exercise they get is the walk from the couch to the fridge or the 30 minutes when they are at the mall. Unfortunately, people do not walk around the mall every day for their daily exercise routine. Decreasing the use of cars would promote people to use their physical energy in order to get to their desired destination. This would also result in having stores and other services of use closer by, so people will be more willing to walk to them. In Bogotá, Colombia parks and sport centers have been opening all over the city"
"Dear principle I think students shouldn't do community service because it takes time away from things they have to do like school work or after school activities it's not a bad idea, but my opinion is that you shouldn't have students doing community service for example if there's a student that don't have good grades and needs to catch up having to do community service wouldn't help at all and the student wouldn't have time to catch up. Another example is that students like to do after school activities like play sports and do other things and if every student was required ton do community service there wouldn't be time for after school activities or time to catch up on homework or missing work. But we can also benefit from it because then our school would always be clean and helping younger students with there work is also a good idea because that makes the older students feel good about helping younger students and putting a good example so when they get to middle school they will make good choices and have good grades. But my final decision is no every student should not be required to do community service."
"Seeking opinions can help you make better decisions. ""Two brains are better than one."" See now everyone has heard this quote at least one time in their life. And that's because it's true! Seeking multiple opinions can help someone make better choices because, more minds the better, different people from different cultures can have other ideas. And also it's good to have conversations about something that you're not sure on."
"More minds the better. You know all those tall buildings built in the city? Yeah, those took many minds to make, over 1,000 engineers worked on the world's the tallest building. What if only one engineer made the design plans? I bet you it wouldn't even get past the drawing board. Everyone has heard the ""We're stronger together"" or ""Team work makes the dream work."" Now, do you know everything about airplanes? I bet not, so that's why you would talk to someone that does know something about planes. 99% of engineers need someone else to work for them because they don't know something. See, that's a perfect example of a way that we need other people to help us by using their knowledge that they have and that we don't. But overall everyone is better together and not better divided."
"Different people from different cultures can other backgrounds and ideas. You may think that one word is good, but then your friend from a different country might think that that word is horrible! See now no one person is the same so that's why sometimes if you have and opinion on something then maybe you should ask someone else that has a different cultural background from you. One thing that famous politicians do is check with other people with different backgrounds to make sure that they don't offend people when they don't want to. Before you go out and start blabbing on about some other country maybe you should try and talk to the people from that country, so then you don't offend them? You as a person will never be the same as anyone else. I personally have friends from other countries that eat dogs but look here, in the USA if someone eats a dog, that is very illegal. That's a perfect example of how people with other backgrounds will differ in opinions. So as you've read, most people that are different from you will widely differ in opinions from you."
"It's good to have conversations about something you're not sure on. Everyone that is successful right now has asked at least one person for help, I can guarantee you that. So if you need help just ask! It's one of the best ways you can get help anyway. There are over 1,000 different information databases that can help you find information on anything. One that I like is Wikipedia it may not be 100% reliable, but that's only if you're ignorant while reading it. Wikipedia has over a million topics of information that you can browse. See this may not seem like your asking for help, but it is one way you can. I only listed one good source of information but overall there are hundreds of sources for information, and you can get help from any of them."
But the best you can do is always seek for more information and keep on learning. That's why more than one person's advice is better only one person's advice. So I challenge you to go out into the world and to keep asking questions and to stay educated!
"First off I don't think there are a such thing as aliens so I don't think that would be the case. I'm here to tell you guys and ladies that this is a natural landform built from rocks piled up and all around each other. If you think the aliens did it how could they have done it if it's sticking outside the ground instead of inside. As you see in the pictures when the years go by the cameras and pictures get better Ashe face structure starts to disappear, and it makes it look like a bunch of rocks. They don't know if they have actually seen a face they said it was winter on that side when this picture was token. So there were clouds and just a lot of stuff covering the cameras when they took the picture. This is a natural landform from rocks and other stuff but I would see why you would think that. It is kind of weird to see other things like this on other planets that don't even have human life or something close to it for this to happen. You should have already known it wasn't a face when JPL website said it wasn't, and it was just a natural landform like all the other craters."
"Being a seagoing cowboy was much more than adventure, for me. I love being able to go out on the sea and have fun will helping people with their problems make me super happy, and I wouldn't have this job if my friend didn't tell me about it. For example (the world war11) I got to go to many places like China, Europe, and Italy."
"I was happy to help all this people with their problems and when we got to go on a ship, we had the opportunity to take turns to watch over the animals at night to feed them and to make sure that nothing bad is happening like fighting our the bottom of the ship is being filled up with water."
"So I signed up to watch them, and so I got the job. I had to stay up super late to watch them and to I went to tell the captain that every thing was okay and so on my way I slipped on some water and I fell."
"I had almost fallen overboard, but I didn't, thanks to a piece of meat on the side of the boat and I was happy that I didn't die. Furthermore, I am thankful that I am still alive after breaking my ribs, and sliding down a latter. Furthermore, I soon recovered and was back to the job, and so we took all the animals back to where they were."
"So we made a game place were they were. We played a bunch of games, and we did are rooted, until we had another job were we had to go get animals and watch over them. I am thankful to be able to do this job with people who care about me and support me well this job."
I wonder what are next job will be? Will I break another bone in my body? Can I survive another animal watch? Will I survive breaking another bone in my body? I don't know if I can survive another bone in my body that can be broken?
"After about a month we get a call to go get some animals, and so we went to go get them and I have to say it was a long ride to go to Teams, and it was close to were my uncle lived, and so we got there and there was a huge sand storm, and so we had to go get all the horses, and take them to the sea and then I realized that my uncle had this one horse, and it did not like me at all. As we were getting the surrounding horses have seen that horse. The captain asked me if I wanted to watch the animals that week and I said "", Yes I will'. So I was up all night watching all the horses, and so I had to feed them. I was feed the one horse that hated me the most, and it kicked me right in the neck as I was feeding him. I was out for a really long time and my best friend came down there and found me on the floor ""sleeping""."
"He woke me up and said are you ok, and I said yes, and so I tried to get up, but I couldn't and then I realized that my neck was broken."
"So I was rushed to the hospital and I had to get a neck brace and let me say that thing was a pain in the neck. I was sent back to the ship, and so I could work, so I asked where are all the horses. My best friend said we sent them back. I said okay, I didn't really care about that. At this point I didn't care about anything. A few weeks past and I was able to get back to work and I didn't have to wear the neck brace anymore. The captive said"", No more working nights anymore"". I said"", I agree I can't risk breaking another bone in my body"". So I didn't work on nights any more which didn't bother me at all."
"Imagine a town where the streets are empty of cars and stores and shops are just a walk down main street.  Well that town exists, it's called Vauban, Germany a town on the border of the Swiss and France.  People who live there gave up their cars and now live a different type of life.  Most people who have done this are happy they can just walk to places.  Back in the 50s this would be the town to live in.  It still has a strong appeal to people.  The way it is run makes it one of the most interesting town in Europe."
This plan worked for them why can't we do this in Bradenton?  Now this type of town would benefit anyone.  People would save money.  The town or city would make double or even more of what they are making in public transportation.  The environment would get healthy and make any town less polluted and help in the fight of greenhouse gases.
We all know how expensive gas can be and how it goes up and down.  With cars being taken out the only thing we'd need gas for is buses that would transport us.  Our wallets will thank us and so will the planet.
"Speaking of the planet greenhouse gases are the talk of the town and will not stop unless we do something.  We can help by doing this plan.  We can never undo what we have done to the ozone layer.  However, we can certainly not make it worse by doing this.  In fact, we could cut down pollution and make Bradenton the city it once was."
"When I first get interest in the medicine area, what I what was help people, be like the doctors that helped my little brother; learn how someone can save lives. Today Mr. can help me to learn more to help others, to help who needs. Its necessary start to think in the future doctors, start to pass the learning to the next generation, the theories, and the growth of the modern medicine."
"This partnership can teach me what the doctor learn all this year's. To learn of the doctors can help me to learn why the things are doing this way, for example em de patient stop to breathe the doctor has to put a tub to the patient start to breathe; and if this doesn't work the doctor has to do a mini-surgery. The reason why when someone brake a leg the time of the recuperation is different; the reason why when a car chars happen the patient has to went to a T.C. The reason why cancer happen, if it is in our DNA or can happen to anyone."
"This partnership can help me to learn the theories. The theories of the causes for the repenting blinding, or way some patients wake up to the coma and others don't. How will be possible in the future faith with the cancer and the autism to help the people that have it; how its possible someone o broke the cervical walk again. If it's possible create a substitute to the glasses, what will be the percentage of people who have obesity in the future."
"This partnership can help me to learn the growth of the modern medicine. Talk about how the treatment to the cancer cell can be done with radiation, and what can be done to change this process because of the negative effects in the humans body. Talk about the big number of surgery in the kids, and how it's possible do something do the recuperation be less painful to the kid and to the parents. Talk about how is possibly prepared the kids for an emergency and how act in one."
"Some may say that learn knew things is boring. Yes, sometimes it's, but if you learn knew things this can help in your future, and prepared you to possibility that you haven't imagined. Some may think that teenage are just kids and is not necessary to think about the future. Yes we are kids, but in other hand we are the future and if we don't think about it who will think for us?"
"Its necessary start to think in the future doctors, the growth of the modern medicine start to pass the learning to the next generation, the theories, and start to pass the learning to the next generation. So Mr. I really hope that you chose me and gave me a chance to me for prove myself, and learn many knew things in this process that will help me to grow as a person, and as a future provisional that can learn knew things every moment in the medicine area, the future is coming, and we are the chose that you want to make."
"It can be valuable because it will keep students from getting bored and falling asleep or not paying attention to actually staying on track. In paragraph six he says that ""A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored."" Then it could modify the lesson like an effective human instructor."" He also says that ""Most human communication is nonverbal, including emotional communication and computers need to understand that to."" In paragraph 5 he says that""The computer can even be used on paintings such as the ""Mona Lisa."" In paragraph 1 he says ""The Mona Lisa is 83 percent happy,9 percent disgusted,6 percent fearful and 2 percent angry'. Could any normal person say that about the Mona Lisa I don't think anyone's possibly of doing that. Therefore, I think that reading the emotional expressions of students in a classroom is valuable because it could change the way students and other people learn and think about school They'll be a lot more motivated and more focused on their work because the computer is adjusting to how they feel either if its beeping bored or confused it could modify itself to make it not as boring or have the student actually understand it. It's also changing the future if technology such as video game characters and video surgery its making their faces more expressive which gives gamers a sense of knowledge on how the character is feeling about the certain station their in or by giving gamers a certain type of feeling toward that character like their there in the action or have a feeling of like what they would do in the situation or the game. "
"Students would definitely benefit from being able to take classes in home by the way of online classrooms. Especially in the time we are in now, the Coronavirus is traveling through the world and school is one of the biggest ways of continually spreading it. If students get the option to take classes online and in the home, they would still be getting their education and keeping everyone safe. Another reason is if students have to take a day off for a reason which could be being sick, family event, or just wanting to stay home. Taking the class online would stop them from getting behind in the class work and keeping up with everyone else in the class. Some say that the students should only be learning in the classroom should not have to take those matters in the home. Also, if students missed school and could just take an online class to keep up. That would be a big reason for students to stay home and not come to school, because why deal with the stress of school when you have it all in your home."
"Since the outbreak of the Coronavirus, schools all over the United States have already been reverting to online classrooms. In fact, our own county is deciding whether to take this action, as to not spread the disease and giving students the option to still get their education. If the option to not take classes online was not put into action, students would come into school and spread the virus to one another, and possibly pass it to one of own teachers and take it into our home."
"Another reason that online classrooms would be useful to the education of students is if a student is absent from a day of school and has to make up work for the classes that day. Instead of waiting until the student is back at school to get the work that was missed, they can go to the online classroom and do the work that was due, as to not fall behind in the curriculum."
"In conclusion, online classrooms would benefit the education system tremendously because it would help students not fall behind on work that was missed when missing a day of school. Also help eradicate the spread of a dead disease continuing to plague the United States."
"First, the author suggests that studying Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers it presents because Venus is the second planet from the sun. Venus has the hottest surface temperature of any planet in our solar system. Venus can have a lot of dangers, since it's closer to the sun and the sun is really hot all 365 days a year. Venus is never going to be like Earth, it has all four types of weather all year around and Venus has only dangerous weathers all year around."
"Secondly, a piece of evidence that supports my claim is in paragraph 3 it says,"" A thick atmosphere of almost 97 percent carbon dioxide blankets Venus. "" That piece of evidence shows that Venus has a lot of chemicals in their air pollution and that's why barely any people go visit the planet. Next, another piece of evidence that supports my claim is in paragraph 3 it says,"" On the planet's surface, temperature average over 800 degrees Fahrenheit, and the atmosphere pressure is 90 times greater than what we experience on our own planet. "" That piece of evidence shows that Venus is a very hot planet since it close to the sun too, that means of one day you would go to Venus you would have to drink a lot of water to stay hydrated. Lastly, a piece of evidence that supports my claim in paragraph 3 it says,"" Beyond high pressure and heat, Venusian geology and weather present additional impediments liking erupting volcanoes, powerful earthquakes, and frequent lighting strikes to probes seeking to land on its surface. "" That piece of evidence shows that Venus can have any type of weather every single day that is different according to the temperature."
"In conclusion, that's why I think the author suggests that studying Venus is worthy pursuit despite the dangers it presents. The conditions in Venus are too extreme for humans to handle. People that would go to Venus probably would only last maybe a day. The next day they would want to go back to Earth and never come back to Venus again."
"First, for example some people prefer working in group because they would get extra help. The other person in the group becomes with a new idea. I think working in group it is fun because each person in the group would l help. That why I prefer working in group than alone because the percentage of working alone is I can not get help from anyone. Also, I can not finish it early it would take long."
"Second, for example If I work in group we would discuss first and then be an agreement. Then start working each person in group would have to answer and with different answer. If anyone in the group does not know the answer the group would help him or her. It is easy and fast to finish any class work if it is in group. Working in group it is fun because each person learn from another idea of the other person."
"Third, working by yourself it is kinda hard. Some people prefer working by themselves because they think it's better. Working alone is more stressful. That why people should work in group. It helps, and it is better and less use of their mind."
"Fourth, for example if I do a classwork by myself, and it is hard. It would take me more time to do the researches in google. Also, I would finish it late. That why I prefer working in group than alone."
"Fifth, finally I would like to recommend to each student to work in group unless they are smart enough to do it by themselves. However, some students or people like to work alone if they smart then probably they would finish it on time. Teacher should be agreed with me. When students work in group it is less stressful because they can he leach other. Therefore, students or people should work together because it is less stressful, and would benefit a lot."
"You should join the Seagoing Cowboys program! We get to do so many things and have fun. This is also a great way to help out communities and people in need. If the trip gets boring, just do something entertaining to pass the time. Most importantly, it would be the time of your life."
"The Seagoing Cowboys get to look around at the places we stop and go sightseeing. Even though we have to take care of the animals and clean their stalls, it gives you a chance to feel good about what you are doing. On the trips back home they entertain themselves by playing games, reading, playing table-tennis tournaments, and boxing. On one trip I even got to see the Acropolis in Greece!"
"In conclusion, Joining the Seagoing Cowboys would be a great experience for anyone. It also gives people the chance to really pitch in and help out anybody in need or a city that needs supplies to live off of. If you are thinking about joining the Cowboys, you should because they would be glad to have some more helping hands. "
"The electoral college, despite being established by the constitution, is a corruptible system that should be abolished. The ultimate duty of the government is to protect and serve the people of America, yet our votes must go through this extra step to pick what will ultimately affect us most."
"When we vote, we choose who will be running our affairs for the next four years. America needs a president who can govern us in this world of problems, so why would the system overlook portions of the public? What keeps the Members of the college in line with public interests? There is too much instability in the college for it to always align with the best interest of the American people because in its ""winner takes all"" policy it overlooks all members of that state who voted otherwise. The college looks at us like divided pieces, when we really are a whole puzzle. For example, when the majority of Floridians vote for one candidate, while just over half of the population of Texas votes for the other, looking at these two states only Texas would win, despite more people in total voting for the other candidate. This may not seem like a common occurrence, as article three stated it has happened only twice since 1888, but there is nothing to keep such actions from progressing."
"What service does the Electoral college serve that the people cannot? Its only purpose in the government is to elect the president. The public, however, is the life and soul of America. The government exists solely to keep order among us. There is no reason why a popular vote wouldn't show the best interest of the people, and a popular vote doesn't overlook any vote."
"The greatest problems lie with the tie-breakers, because in the event of a tie, the election's result goes to the legislature. A few people in congress are looking to fuel their own desires. When presented with the chance to earn more money, they would rather choose the option that will earn them more, even if it means going against the interest of the public."
"The electoral college isn't a complete public enemy, however. The electoral votes are decided based upon a popular vote, so they reflect the public's interest, if a little distorted. Maine and Nebraska have an alternate setup of ""proportional representation"" as explained in article one. If anything is to be done, a simple reform would suffice. If electoral votes were awarded per a set number of people, it would better reflect the population than if votes were awarded entirely based upon the will of a state as a whole."
"Having extracurricular activities at school can be enjoyable for students but they shouldn't be forced to have to participate in them. Extracurricular activities should be a choice not a rule. Most kids have things they want or need to do after school and don't have time to participate in extra activities. Also keep in mind that students need to be able to spend time with their families and themselves. Students shouldn't have to participate in extracurricular activities because students may not have time, also students have other responsibilities than school, students should not have to participate in something that they don't want to do."
"Students have things they want to do after they get out of school. If that student has to stay after school they will miss out on the things that they were interested in doing. School takes up the majority of a students' day, so students should be able to have that freedom of having time to do the things that they want to do. A students' life shouldn't just reflect on school, they should be able to go out and have fun and live their lives without having to worry about school all the time. Students also need to be able to have time to spend with their friends and family."
"Students have other big responsibilities beside going to school. Some students may have to go home and take care of a younger sibling or some may have chores that they need to complete. A student may need to be at home at a certain time, extra activities could interfere with that. Students may have pets or other things they need to take care of when they get home. Also, students need time to be able to take care of themselves and practice personal hygiene."
"Making it a rule for kids to have to participate in extra activities should not be allowed. Students should be able to participate in things if they want to, not if they have to. Especially, being forced to choose from things that may not fit your interests. Having to be involved with a certain activity can interfere with what students need to complete at home or anywhere else. Activities are supposed to be enjoyable, but they aren't when you are required to do them."
"In conclusion, activities are better when chosen and not required. Students need to have that kind of freedom where they can choose if they want to participate in something that takes up their time. Students should be able to leave school and have time to enjoy themselves without worrying about school. Students will try harder in activities that they enjoy, rather than what is forced. Students should be able to have a choice of what they want to put their time and energy into.  "
"Dear Principle,"
"I think that students should be required to perform community service because if we can make a change in the world we should do it or at least try because if one person makes a change so will others. Like for example littering people don't realize they are destroying the nature by throwing garbage all over, and it doesn't look good if you are trying to enjoy yourself in a park with garbage all over, so we should try to pick up trash all over and serve our community and make the world a better looking place."
"Community service doesn't always have to be bearing or a waste of time because it could also be fun like you can shovel snow, or Babysit u can just take a time when you are not doing anything and go out and better the world. Although u may not realize but by helping the community you are making yourself look good and also your community. You make people feel better about where they live and u can also put smiles on peoples face's, and it will make u feel proud. Although community service is free you do it to better your community and everything you do will help you in the long run whether it makes u a better person or whether it helps you achieve great standards."
"This is why students should have to do community service because it will help us achieve, and the world to succeed. This is our world and let's make it a better one for our futures generation. We can all make a change."
"I think the principal is right. Did you know that the kids who do exercise activities learn faster and there brain can concentrate more? As a principal you are supposed to be looking out for the children and caring for their education. The reasons why I agree with the principal is because kids can get sometimes bored and have nothing to do, kids also need to stop being so lazy all the time, and maybe kids could find talents that they didn't even know about."
"The first reason why I agree with the principal is that kids can get bored sometimes. If kids have nothing to do they can go play there basketball ball game that day or go practice outside. Instead of sitting on the couch all day watching TV they can go to chess club or any other clubs in there school. If they go do school activities they will get more exercise and can use there energy for more than just pressing buttons on a remote. For example, I made b-team soccer and since I made it I get to spend with friends more and see my other family more."
"The second reason why I agree with the principal is that kids now days are very lazy. They don't listen and all they want to do is sit on the couch and watch TV or play video games. I love watching TV and playing video games, but I still get up and go outside or go play with my brothers or sisters. Being lazy is not a good thing you will get nowhere in life if you are lazy all the time. I love going to my practices and spending time with family TV and video games are always last in my life, and maybe it should be for you to. And also doing school activities will allow you to spend more time with friends."
"The third reason why I agree with the principal is that kids could find talents that they didn't even know about. If you are lazy all the time you won't won't ever find out things about yourself. For example if you are one of those kids who are known as the kid in the corner and you don't ever try anything new you won't ever be able to accomplish your dreams. And also if you find out that you are perfect at basketball or soccer you could one day maybe because a famous NBA or MLS player. If you found out that you are perfect at something, and you made perfect money off of it you could give some to charity or to hospital or to churches. If you find a talent that your perfect at you could inspire others to do the same."
Those were the reasons why I agreed with the principal. I hope me telling you all those things help you learn that laziness is not the answer. I really hope that I inspired you to agree with the principal. So hopefully now you will get of the TV or video games and go spend time with family or go to some after school activities and enjoy the freedom you have because not everyone has that freedom.
"I am against driverless cars because of many reasons. One reason I'm against driverless cars because in paragraph 9 it talks about what if there was an accident who would be the fault the manufacture or the driver. I think the manufacturer should be the fault because it's not the person using the product it's the person who build it. They relied on them, so they should be held accountable for the situation. Then it says in paragraph 7 they are also considering using cameras to watch that drivers are remaining focused on the road. Then turns around and says some manufacturers hope that they can install entertainment in the car for the driver. I believe that if they are getting entertained in the car how would they focus on the road. Also, it says such displays can be turned off instantly. Just because it can doesn't mean it will. Another reason is the car is supposed to watch the person then how does the car drive itself."
"In my opinion I think online schooling won't benefit any student because, you don't have a teacher in front of you explaining what to do. Video conferencing is something different, you basically at school but on a screen. You'll be able to hear the teacher while she's explaining the assignment and teach it to you better so that way you understand more, and you can be able to ask questions. Looking at a screen and reading an assignment isn't going to help you much. If you have an actual teacher, she/he goes into details and shows you examples of how to do an assignment. Being homeschooled is pretty challenging. Most online schooled kids tend to procrastinate and end up falling behind. Most shy kids are homeschooled or video conferencing because of problems or any other thing that's going on with them. If students want to attend online and video conferencing, then that's fine as long as their getting their education and finishing their assignments. It's the law for every student to go to school or to do something that's related to school. Online classes are pretty expensive to pay up, so students must complete their assignments because they'll charge you for it either way. I think attending school would be better. Teachers teach you better and help you out when you don't understand something. You get less homework and maybe even easier homework to do. You don't need to pay anything for your child to go to a public school. Your student gets taught well. So in that case I think going to school is better than online class and video conferencing. "
A major form of transportation that has been around for a long time is driving in cars.
"Now, people are relying less on cars and are finding different methods of commuting. Some countries are even banning cars. Limiting car usage will have many advantages, such as reducing stress and benefitting the environment."
"Cars come with a large amount of responsibility, which causes people to have stress."
"Many people are actually happier without cars. Hadron Walter, a media trainer and a mother of two, stated that ""When I had a car, I was always tense. I'm much happier this way."" Source 1: In German Suburb, Life Goes On Without Cars by Elisabeth Rosenthal People can be tense from having a car because they have to do things like pay for insurance, pay the monthly bill for the actual car, pay for gas, and worry about where to park. Living a life without a car means that you are saving money, and you are walking and biking more. ""Parks and sports centers also have bloomed throughout the city."" Source 3: Carefree day is spinning into a big hit in Bogotá by Andrew Silky Due to the lowering in the number of cars, people are being able to go outside more into new parks, go workout with friends, or just enjoy the outdoors. All of this is healthy and good for a person, and causes a person to relax and feel less stressed. Due to no cars on the road in Carefree day, there is no such thing as rush hour traffic, so people do not have to worry about leaving early or standing in traffic for a long period of time. Many who drive cars tend to have road rage, causing them to shout or get mad, which is not good for their health. People that drive to work on their bikes or use public transportation will not experience road rage, which will cause them to be happier. ""It's a good opportunity to take away stress and lower air pollution"" said businessman Carlos Arturo Plaza as he rode a two seat bicycle with his wife. Source 3: ""Carefree day is spinning into a big hit in Bogotá"" by Andrew Silky Carefree day allowed this man to go to work in a fun way with his wife, enjoying the outdoors while also spending time together. If he had taken a car to work, he might have not gone with his wife and had a good time. Limiting car usage will lead to less stress and happier people in the long run."
A big reason for the great amount of pollution in the world today is from cars.
"Reducing the number of cars will also lead to a better environment with cleaner air. ""Passenger cars are responsible for 12 percent of greenhouse gas emissions in Europe... and up to 50 percent in some car intensive areas in the United States."" Source 1: In German Suburb, Life Goes On Without Cars by Elisabeth Rosenthal Pollution is a major problem in many counties, such as the United States, and limiting the amount of cars on the road will surely have a positive impact on the environment. It will not do any harm. ""If the pattern persists and many sociologists believe it will have beneficial implications for carbon emissions and the environment, since transportation is the second-largest source of America's emissions, just being power plants."" Source 4: The End of Car Culture by Elisabeth Rosenthal Since transportation is one of the major reasons for the amount of pollution in America, imagine the benefit to the environment that will occur if the amount of driving and car usage becomes limited. This is a very ambitious goal to curb America's greenhouse gas emissions. It is proven that fuel in cars is blamed for polluting counties. For example, Diesels make up 67 percent of vehicles in France, and is also blamed for polluting the country. Source 2: Paris bans driving due to smog by Robert Duffer Smog is caused by the pollution, and is the key factor to the reason why Paris is banning driving. The only place the ban of cars will negatively affect is the car industry. People use their car sometimes for necessary situations, such as driving to a friends house if they live a short distance away. ""The Internet makes telecommuting possible and allows people to feel more connected without driving to meet friends."" Source 4: The End of Car Culture by Elisabeth Rosenthal It is not always needed to drive somewhere to meet up with someone. Technology nowadays, such as cellphones and computers, allow us to call, text, or video chat with people who are far away. This saves time and gas, and will be better for the environment."
"Cars are not always necessary for commuting, and they also cause stress. They are harming our environment by polluting it with its carbon emissions. There are other ways of transportation, such as public transportation, walking, or riding your bike. Limiting the amount of car usage will lead to people being healthier and less stressed, as well as the air being cleaner."
Dear principle
"I am aware that you may take the action of making community service a requirement to all students. This action is inevitably going to cause controversy among students. I, for one, am very against this upcoming decision. Not only would this cause disruption, but it is also unfair, and will be just like forcing students to work using physical means to receive a good grade."
Now then let's take a dive into what your pending decision would impact upon us.
"Let's face it many students do not or would not opt to participate in community service, its just unavoidable. Many or a majority of the students would refuse to partake in this service. I doubt I would not hear complaints about this very soon. Who knows what actions those who opposes being required for service would take? They might use various as well as dangerous means to let their voices be heard."
"Not only that but in my opinion it would be unjust to require us to do physical activity. Although not on a serious level like something like slaves would be, but this is the United States of"
"America. We should have the right to refuse community service, and let the voluntary people do the work that they want to partake in. Again as stated before think of what those who oppose would take not only during the pre-anger state of mind before doing service but during the service. They could do the opposite of what they are asked to do during the activities."
Most things in life come with or without reward? Right? Well if the case (and it would be very likely to). We were to receive a grade for participation in cleaning up our community that would be unfitting. We already have physical education to make us do physical work for a letter grade. Although P. E does this to some extent community service would be outrages. Sweating for an A ? I quite frankly do not think so.
"Is that enough for you? Is that enough to make you postpone or abort this decision? Well if you want to have rebels around the school you obviously do not. Hey, or maybe if you want to accomplish the opposite of your original goal, do it. If you want to be the principle who accepted this offer to make us do unfair activities, well then go right ahead. I think I have proven my point in bold fashion, do you disagree?"
"Dear Principle,"
"In my opinion I choose policy 2, against cell phones. Policy 2 would best fit this school, I will tell you two reasons why."
"The first reason is a lot of kids steal and lose there cell phones at school, and sometimes they never get them back. So to lower the rate of people losing there cell phones we should not bring are cell phones to school period."
"The second reason was that the kids at school try to talk and text during class, that is why there phones always go off. So they should keep their phone off or just not bring it to school it causes to many distractions, and we can not all afford to be held back because we were to busy paying attention to are phones."
"I want every kid to make good grades, but they cannot do that if they try to talk or text during class. I'm not saying don't ever have a cell phone all I'm saying is to keep them away from school grounds and if some kids try to think they are cool and have there cell phone at school then they should get a referral for not obeying school rules."
"Sincerely,"

"""After days of near-record pollution, Paris enforced a partial driving ban to clear the air of the global city.""(source 2). Cars have been a great help to people but now their boarding the line of help and hurt. The advantages of limiting car usage almost never end. There's always a way for you to limit your use of your car. It's great for the plant. Also, it brings ease to you. Then last is that it brings people together."
"To began with is that it's great for there plant. For example in Bogotá, Colombia every year for three years they would have a car free day. That is when everyone would leave their cars at home and use a bike or some alternative transportation to get to where they have to be. If you choose to do the opposite then you would be fined a $25 fee for using your car. The goal was to promote alternative transportation and reduce smog. This also happens in Paris, were they banned cars because of smog. Even if the fee was $31 dollar Almost 4,OOO drivers were fined."
"In addition to that is that it brings ease to you. Stated in the first source, ""When I had a car I was always tense. I'm much happier this way."" Hadron Walter said that. When you don't have to think about any car problem you worry less. Even now there has been a decline in the percentage of 16- to 39-year-old's getting a license. It's not a priority anymore. With cars comes worries, and people today don't want any worries."
Last but not least is that it brings people together. Usual when we are driving in our cars we hardly look to see who's driving next to us. But if you take out the cars you can really see wants around you. Meet people while you ride your bicycles. You would see the world differently.
"In conclusion, limiting cars would benefit you in so many ways. One like bringing you closer to the people around you. Also, without as many cars it would help the plant. Last it would bring ease to you. Overall the less the cars the better everyone and everything should feel.  "
"Dear state senator,"
"I write to argue in favor of the Electoral College. The Electoral College is as it says on the 3rd source ""widely regarded as an anachronism, a non-democratic method of selecting a president that ought to be [overruled] by declaring the candidates who receive the most popular votes the winner."" That was in my opinion pretty self-explanatory. This letter is based on information from article sources I read."
"First, I would like to start by saying that the Electoral College is helpful to avoid problems where no candidate got a majority. For example in the 5th part of the source 3 it says ""Nixon in 1968 and Clinton in 1992 both had only 43 percent plurality of the popular votes, while winning a majority in the Electoral College (301 and 370 electoral votes, respectively)"" which backs up my claim. I understand the ""wrong"" part of it like in the 2nd source it says ""If you lived in Texas, for instance, and wanted to vote for [John] Carry, you'd vote for a slate of 34 Democratic electors pledged to Kerry."" meaning voters vote for a slate of electors, and they choose the president. Honestly I don't see it as that ""wrong"" but that's my opinion."
"Second, I agree with the Electoral College despite the lack of ""democratic pedigree"" for five reasons. First, ""Certainty of Outcome"" meaning winning candidate's share of the Electoral College exceeds his share of the popular vote, example, Obama vs Romney. Second, in the's President part it says that no region has enough electoral votes to elect a president, for example, ""Romney was in the South, has no incentive to campaign heavily in those states, for he gains no electoral votes increasing his plurality in states that he knows he will win"". Number 3, ""Swing States"" the ""winner takes all method of awarding electoral votes induces the candidates-as we saw in [2012] election-to focus their campaign efforts on the toss-up states"". There is also number 4 where the Electoral College ""restores some weight in the political balance that large states lose virtue of the mal-apportionment of the Senate decreed in the Constitution"" and there is number 5, ""Avoid Run-Off Elections"" which is what I used in the second paragraph as a claim."
"In summation I'm in favor with the Electoral College for many reasons. After reading through this side and the opposing side of the argument I can honestly say that I prefer this method as it is. Yes there is a bad side to it, but there is a bad side to everything, and it shouldn't be big enough for anyone to oppose it. Well thank you for taking the time to read through this."
"Luke is trying to convince people to be in the Seagoing Cowboys program by saying cool things that he does. For example: he is saying that he toured an excavated castle in Crete and marveled at the Panama Canal on his way to China. He also said that he finds time to have fun on board. Some games they played were baseball, volleyball, Table tennis tournaments, fencing, boxing, reading, and whittling."
"Luke got to list different places, and he got to go to 16 different places. Luke also got to go to the Atlantic Ocean. Luke also liked to see the animals. He would always go visit the animals and feed them. Another thing Luke would do is help people that got hurt during the War."
"So those are a lot of fun things that Luke did. He also did a lot of good things. Like feed animals, take them from one place to another, and help people that got hurt in the War. Luke shared all those fun and good things that he did to convince others to participate the Seagoing Cowboys program.  "
"The effect of cars in our world today has grown tremendously. As companies create new models of various cars, buyers don't often think twice about how these cars hurt the environment and cause serious global emissions. The production of ""Hybrids"" is the first step to solving this problem. The advantages of limiting car usage can result in a decrease in pollution, a more relaxed personal budget, and a safer community."
"Pollution amounts have skyrocketed in the past several years. Due to the increase in the amount of people on the road using motor vehicles, pollution has increased and is becoming more of a threat than ever before. In Vauban, Germany, a new community has been constructed, and contains suburban pioneers that have given up their cars. They are devoted to taking public transit, such as city buses, or even personal vehicles like a bicycle. ""As a result, 70 percent of Vauban's families do not own cars, and 57 percent sold a car to move here."" (Car-Free Cities, Source 1: In German Suburb, Life Goes On Without Cars.) The residents of this community are committed to preserving Earth by limiting their car usage to reduce pollution. Pollution is a harmful matter that can cause negative effects to an area. ""Passenger cars are responsible for 12 percent of greenhouse gas emissions in Europe...and up to 50 percent in some car-intensive areas in the United States."" (Car-Free Cities, Source 1: In German Suburb, Life Goes On Without Cars.) When you limit the amount of time you use your car, not only does it reduce pollution, but it also saves you money, now that you are not paying a monthly fee, or taxes on the car, or for gas every month."
"In the exquisite community in Vauban, Germany, many of those people have gotten rid of their car, and are now probably saving extremely high amounts of money. Between highway tolls, gas, oil changes, insurance, and the overall monthly payment on a car, these residents are saving so much money because they are not paying for all of these necessities. When they travel, they use public transit, like the city bus, which costs a fraction of what car owners pay. Paris is trying to limit the amount of individual transportation due to the smog in the area, so they made a deal. ""Public transit was free of charge from Friday to Monday, according to the BBC."" (Source 2: Paris bans driving due to smog.) People taking public transit are saving even more money now. Due to the intense smog in Paris, and the busy streets, a limit was set for the amount of drivers allowed on the road throughout the week. ""On Monday motorists with even-numbered license plates were ordered to leave their cars at home or suffer a 22-euro fine ($31). The same would apply to odd-numbered plates the following day. Almost 4,000 drivers were fined, according to Reuters... Twenty-seven people had their cars impounded for their reaction to the fine."" (Source 2: Paris bans driving due to smog.) Compared to the amount of money car owners spend, people without a car save a lot more money."
"With the reduction of car usage, a safer community will result as well. The amounts of accidents will be substantially lower. With fewer cars on the road, the risks of car crashes greatly decrease. Many accidents result in impatience at the wheel, and careless drivers. ""Congestion was down 60 percent in the capital of France, after five-days of intensifying smog..."" (Source 2: Paris bans driving due to smog.) Bogotá, Columbia created a day for no car usage, and it turned out to be a very big success, spreading across borders and leaving an impression on other countries about how limited car usage positively effects the environment. ""It was the third straight year cars have been banned with only buses and taxis permitted for the Day Without Cars in this capital city of 7 million. The goal is to promote alternative transportation and reduce smog. Violators faced $25 fines."" (Source 3: Car-free day is spinning into a big hit in Bogotá.) Countries across the globe are attempting to limit car usage, and it will begin to greatly help the environments. ""Recent studies suggest that Americans are buying fewer cars, driving less and getting fewer licenses as each year goes by."" (Source 4: The End of Car Culture.)"
"The effect of cars today is not a positive thing, except for hybrid cars. Countries are beginning to limit car usage, and soon we will see the impact and changes in the environments due to car reduction. Clearly, the advantages of limiting car usage result in a decrease in pollution, a more relaxed personal budget, and a safer community."
"Dear Senator, The electoral college is a process that the founding fathers established as a compromise between the election of the President by a vote in Congress and popular vote of the people. This process involves selecting the electors, meeting with the electors, and counting the votes by congress. There are 538 electors total in the Electoral College. The presidential election happens every four years on the Tuesday after the first Monday in November. After the election the governor makes a ""Certificate of Ascertainment"" which has all the names of the candidates who ran for President. I believe we should keep the Electoral College because there is a certainty of outcome, it helps avoid runoff elections, and the electoral college helps balance out the smaller and bigger states with more people that vote."
"The outcome of an Electoral College has a possibility of creating a dispute like in 2000, but this dispute is less likely to happen over a dispute over the popular vote. This is because the winning candidates share of the Electoral College is greater than his share of the popular vote. Obama received 61.7 percent of the electoral vote in comparison to the 51.3 percent of popular votes for him and Mitt Rodney. Transregional appeal is required in the Electoral College. If we got rid of the Electoral College then there would be a greater possibility of dispute."
"Furthermore, Nixon in 1968 and Clinton in 1992 both had a 43 percent plurality of the popular votes while winning a majority in the Electoral College. This proves that the Electoral college avoids the problems of elections in which neither candidate receives a majority of the votes. When no candidate wins a majority the pressure complicates the presidential election process. The Electoral College minimized this pressure be invariably producing a clear winner every time. A majority of 270 electoral votes is required to elect the President."
"In addition, a large state gets more attention from candidates than a small state in a campaign. As an example in 2012 Obama, got 29 electoral votes. In Wyoming the winner only had 2 electoral votes in the same Marin as Obama. The Electoral College provides some kind of restoration for the weight in the political balance that large states lose by apportionment of the Senate. Voters in tossup states are more likely to read into and pay more attention to a campaign because they know they are going to decide the election. It is most likely that these people are going to the most thoughtful voters."
"To conclude, there are many reasons to keep the Electoral College. This process has made the winner of the election much clearer to decide. There are a lot of pros and cons to the Electoral College, but the list of cons is way shorter than the list of all the pros to the Electoral College. We should keep the Electoral College because it creates a certainty of outcome, diminishes runoff elections, and creates a balance for the bigger states. The Electoral College has created a positive impact for our presidential election."
"Eight-hour school days start to become a repetitive process for a lot of people. Kids get told to go out and live while they're young, but school takes up a majority of their time. A lot of students don't want to go to school because they don't want the social interaction, or they don't enjoy it. School is important in life, and they should give an alternative option for students. Students would benefit more from being able to attend classes from home because they can become more independent and responsible, it gives students a chance to learn differently, and it gives kids an opportunity make a flexible schedule that will suit their needs."
"Being independent and responsible is important for life. When students go to school, they learn the basics like English, History, Math, and Science. While those are important, some students might not learn how to become independent, and they will rely on others. Working from home or doing online school teaches them that they need to be responsible and work by themselves. It covers aspects in life where they are able to teach themselves, and they can use that down the road later in life because someone might not always be there to help them."
"Teachers teach in many ways like students learn in many ways. When teachers aren't meeting the criteria for student, that can make school extremely hard and miserable. Sometimes all it takes for a student to understand what they are learning is getting extra help, but other times that isn't enough. Giving students the opportunity of working from home can give them more flexibility on how they learn. Students will have the ability to figure out what works best for them and then be able to use that and become successful in school."
"Students go to school on average 40 hours a week, but there are some weeks when students put in the time and they don't feel like they learned anything. School can be draining especially if it's not moving at the speed the student will be successful at. When that happens some students feel like they could have been doing something more productive with their time like spending it with family and friends, or working towards a goal that they want to meet. Having the ability to work from home gives students the chance to work at their own pace, and they can have a more flexible schedule, so they can succeed in a lot more areas of their life that don't include school."
"Attending school is nothing if students aren't succeeding in it. Giving students an alternative option of getting an education is important. While every student is not the same it is important that there are ways to try and cover everyone's needs. When students work from home they have the ability to become more independent and responsible, they can learn in ways that will help their needs, and give them the opportunity for a flexible schedule. When giving students the options to attend classes online or at home they now have the ability to figure out what works best for them."
"Have you ever thought about what students could do with extra time on their hands? Students would benefit from online learning because it would be easier to focus, they would have more free time, and it can be used when regular schools are not available. Online school has been considered recently and could be coming very soon. If it happens, we could see if it really benefits students in as many ways as we think. Having online school could be a short term solution or as a permanent solution."
"During school, many students can lose focus due to the amount of time they spend in school. By having online school, the usual 7-hour school day would be shortened because of the limitations of online school. Spending 7 hours in school tires the mind and with online school, students can work at their own pace. Students would work better in an environment they are more comfortable with like their bedrooms. The added benefit of being able to take a break whenever would allow students to sleep in instead of having to wake up early in the morning."
"Having online school would give students more free time for other activities like sports or hobbies and would remove the stress that comes with school. With free time on their hands, students could do other things they normally would not be able to like to apply for jobs, practice sports, and spend time with friends. Students that work or are involved with sports do not have much time to complete assignments and can discourage students to take excelled classes. This limit of time can be stressful for students and many students end up staying late in order to finish. By giving the students more free time to work or practice sports, students would be able to complete their work on time without stressing over it."
"Online school can be used for a temporary replacement for regular school in times of emergencies. Students who are unable to attend school due to disease or injury would be able to keep up with the class through online learning. It could prove useful during times of disease outbreaks like coronavirus. Instead of keeping schools open with a risk of infecting students and staff, schools would consider switching to online school for as long as it is needed. Schools could consider using online learning to make up for snow days as well."
"Students would benefit from online school because it would be easier to focus, it would give them more free time, and it could be used as a temporary replacement if needed. Having online school temporarily or permanently would benefit students and teachers alike. The amount of time saved by using online school instead of regular school would be huge. Schools would not have to spend nearly as much time as they do teaching students. The amount of time cut and the mental benefits it would provide for students would be very beneficial to their health and to the way they learn"
The Dissapearene of the Electoral College
"The United States of America has come a long with in regard to its legal system. For example, the new laws that are currently being added to allow gay couples to marry. That shows true progress, however there are other laws that we have, which simply are not needed anymore and are quite outdated. An example of this would be the Electoral College. The system that it abides by is horrendous and unjust. In the eyes of many the Electoral College should be removed from the law and will make Democratic decisions within this country much better."
"Now there are quite a few well known people who believe that the Electoral College should be abolished. These people include Richard Nixon, Jimmy Carter, and Bob Dole just to name a few. One of the biggest controversial events that had to do with a failure of the Electoral College was the election of 2000. In this situation Al Gore won the popular vote but lost the presidency due to the methods of the Electoral College. It all seems to just be an irrational method as well as a waste of time. This is to be believed because you have citizen voters who add up to the popular vote, yet afterwards it is then turned over to the electors who may be unfair and corrupted. The votes would be much simpler and much more fair if it was a direct popular vote. Not to mention that over sixty percent of voters would prefer a direct election as opposed to the method of voting we have now."
"(Source 2, Brad Plume)"
"The way that the Electoral College works is selection of electors, then a meeting of electors where they vote for the President and Vice President, and finally the electoral votes are counted by Congress. All that's done is adding a middleman who makes a decision for the people who spent their time to vote for the candidates they elected. Also, with this ""winner-take-all system"
"(Source 1, The Office of Federal Register)"
"It leaves those who ""chose wrong"" left with nothing, however let it be noted that in Maine and Nebraska there is a variation of ""proportional representation"". Finally, after the election the governor of your state prepares a ""Certificate of Ascertainment"" which lists all the candidates who had run for President in your STAE as well as a list of the representing electors."
"Along the lines of voting not only do voters practically have no say in who they are voting for due to basically voting for representing electors thus It's up to the electors to vote for a President and Vice President, not the people of this nation. For example, if you lived in Texas and wanted to vote for John Kerry, you would end up voting for a slate of thirty-four Democratic electors pledged to Kerry. With the very small chance that the electors won the statewide election kept in mind, they would then have to go to Congress and as a result Kerry would have thirty-four more electoral votes. To be honest this whole system seems to be ridiculously unnecessary and tedious. As said before a direct method of voting from the citizens would be more beneficial to the whole nation. In the end, that is one of the most important things to keep in mind because that is what will end up being affected the most which is the entreaty of the U.S.A."
"Let's not forget that in this while voting via the Electoral College, there is a very apparent disaster factor looming above their heads. When you put it into context that a candidate that a majority of the population of voters appealed to and voted for did not end up being elected because of the choices of the electors there's going to be a huge problem as a result. Not to mention the fact that many are afraid of the chance that there will eventually be a situation where there is a tie. Furthermore, this can also be taken into account in a vice versa manner because if there is a candidate that lost the popular vote but won the votes of the electors there will be ridiculous amounts of uproar to follow. In the close there are just too many complexities and problems that follow the Electoral College, and it would be for the benefit of all if it was abolished.  "
"I think electoral college is a terrible idea. I will be giving some reasons why I think this ""process"" is a horrible thing to do. By the end of my essay I hope you will agree with me that electoral college is a waste of time."
"Electoral college is a ""nondemocratic"" way for electing a new president. I personally think that we should count peoples votes and not decide by the majority of the state. I say this because it's unfair to the people who voted for the President that didn't get elected because the majority of the state voted for the other president."
"Although if most of the state voted for a President that President is guaranteed that he got most of the peoples votes. Another thing that's unfair is that California has more electoral votes than Texas however, there is a chance that Texas is more populated than California. So if the votes were counted by person instead of state there would be a better chance of the President you voted for win the election."
So these are just a few of the reasons why I think electoral college is basically just a huge waste of time and why it's unfair to the states with a lower number of electoral votes. Hopefully they will start to count votes regularly instead of giving each state a certain number of electoral votes.
"To inform fellow citizens about advantages of limiting car usage you would have to tell them everything. Like how residents from Germany upscale community are suburban pioneers, and they have given up their car's. Street parking, driveways and home garages are generally forbidden in their district. Why is this forbidden? I just don't get it. Car owners buy their own space, for $40,000 along with there home. In Europe passenger cars are responsible for 12 percent of greenhouse gas emissions and up to 50 percent in some car intensive areas in the United States."
"In the United States, the Environmental Protection Agency is promoting car reduced. Many experts expect public transport serving suburbs to play a much larger role in a new federal. So fellow citizens should help them out with their limiting car usage. They sure have a lot going on. Like in the end of car culture. There expanses and suburban ideals had long been one of the world's prime car cultures. But American's love affair with its vehicles seems to be cooling. Its seen like they don't mind."
If I was a big huge fellow citizen I would help out with what there going through because I don't think this is right. For them to be having to pay so much more than what we have to pay is not cool. What would we do without car's we can't walk everywhere. That wouldn't be right. They say the day without cars is part of an improvement campaign that began in Bogotá in the mid 1990s.
"What about if it was raining how are we supposed to get to work or get food. We need a car to get to places. They say the rain hasn't stopped people from participating. But I think it has stopped them. Therefore, we need are cars to get to where we need to be.  "
"Google driverless cars are something of the future right? Not anymore the company Google are and did make cars that are driverless in some aspect. They still need human control in certain situations like in passage 7 stating some accidents and work zones human interaction with the mobile vehicle is needed. In a way its much sonicated than human driving more precise as you will. In this case it would be a lot safer for us and the environment as they say in passage 1 saying that the cars would use half the gas we use today. There's more pros than cons in this invention, and it would be a great accomplishment to great a car with these abilities."
"Google cars are here not yet purchasable, but they are made and tested."
"With this long period of time they should create the best safety precautions in the vehicle itself. With these new features I'm sure that they would bring in high safety precaution in these vehicles because this is a new era of mobile vehicles. The fact there would be fewer accidents and fewer human fault accidents. There would be fewer tickets and fewer police officers running around pulling people over. If they make this car how I am thinking they will, they could change everything about the art of driving."
"Less gas more money that's what we all want. More money that's what you'll have after Google release these driverless cars. The bonus will be a healthier environment. Half the gas half the solution. The environment is severely important to us. The air we breathe, the food we eat, the pure decorations, the way we live is based on this huge factor of the environment the healthier it is the better we live. With this car great things will happen outside and inside our wallets."
Based on these facts in the article there's a definite change becoming afloat the way we live will change for a long time. We get a lot of improvements when they release this driverless car the rules will change for the better. We will see our family members safer with these automobiles on the market. Let's make society great again with Google Driverless Cars.
"Students spend much of their summer still working on homework for a class they aren't even currently in. These summer assignments get more difficult the higher level the class. Many schools require the students to complete summer assignments to keep their knowledge from the past school year and to begin learning for the next school year. These assignments should be created by the teacher instead of the students, for it will benefit the students more when the teacher creates them."
"These summer assignments should be teacher designed, for if students made them, they would make them as easy as they would be allowed to. While students are enrolled in school to learn and gain knowledge, they are also being pushed to receive high grades; therefore, they will try to make their own work as easy as possible to ensure a relatively high grade on the assignment. For example, when students do peer reviews in class, students will usually give each other high grades to make sure that the other students are giving them a high grade as well. It doesn't matter how the others truly did, they just want to have a high grade ensured for themselves, so they will give a high grade to anyone. If a student has a way to without a doubt receive 100%, they will make sure of it. If the summer assignment was from Geometry going into Algebra 2, they would pick the most basic algebra questions that they could come up with and use what they thought was the easiest unit in geometry to make up the review portion. The students would create a summer assignment that is too easy for someone at their own learning level, making the summer assignment remotely pointless to the students."
"Half the information on a summer assignment is review from the year before while half is the new information for the coming school year; therefore, students are unable to create their own summer assignments because they wouldn't even know half the information they are writing about. Writing the review portion of the assignment may be able to help the students go over the material once more; however, they gain nothing out of writing the learning portion. If a student is trying to learn something will try to create an assignment for others to learn it, they will just end up confusing themselves and not grab any knowledge from the said subject. Students are doing the learning portion of the assignment to learn new material, hence why the teacher create these assignments in a way to make it easy to teach it to the students even when they are on break. Teachers will use the information in the review portion in the learning portion to make the process easier for the students, making it even more beneficial for the students."
"Summer assignments are a vital part of a students learning experience. These summer projects help students have an easy transition from one school year, through summer, into the next school year. These assignments make it possible to immediately begin learning at the beginning of the school year, for the students already have the background information that they need. If these assignments are made by the teachers instead of the students the will be beneficial for both the kids trying to learn the subject and the teachers who are trying to teach it. "
"In ""The Challenge of Exploring Venus,"" the author suggests that studying Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers it presents. The author saying that many people are very interested in discovering Venus because it's very similar to Earth. But this planet is also a challenging place to examine closely. With thick atmosphere, high temperatures, and the atmospheric pressure is greater than Earth, no spacecraft survived the landing for more than a few hours. That making it difficult for humans to discover it."
"The author supports the idea of how studying Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers is pretty well. Because he had good evidences and details answering the questions. The text states,""Striving to meet the challenge presented by Venus has value, not only because of the insight to be gained on the planet itself, but also because human curiosity will likely lead us into many equally intimidating endeavors. Our travels on Earth and beyond should not be limited by dangers and doubts but should be expanded to meet the very edges of imagination and innovation."" This shows how well the author supported the ideas about studying Venus."
Venus is a dangerous place for humans to visit and examine. But it's worth once you tried it. Many people are interested in Venus and wanted to study more about it in the future. The author did a good passage to supported his ideas about Venus. With many helpful evidences and details.
"Dear, Senator"
"I think we should in take consideration in the next few years about changing are election to popular vote. I feel that are state would benefit positively with the way that popular vote is set up. Looking at the past history the electoral college is not benefiting us in a positive direction. I quote this from the article ""over 60 percent of voters would Peter a direct election""with that being said lets look at the cons of the electoral college."
To begin with the electoral college system the people like me don't get to vote for president I have to vote for someone else to vote for me in that I feel like my vote doesn't count because what happens if I vote for an elector and he doesn't go for my person to win. That just makes me feel dumb then if the elector does vote for the same person same It's not really even final because that vote doesn't go towards the president it goes toward the state elector and its basically there choice. Another con in the electoral college system is that the same fiasco in 2000 will break out again. Were the legislatures are responsible for picking electors and they don't take in to consideration of other people votes. The con that could mostly impact America is a tie in the electoral vote. Another reason the electoral college is a stupid way to vote is that the big states get better privileges than the smaller states they out rule the smaller states. Its final the electoral college is unfair outdated and irrational.
"The only reasons the electoral college is alive now is the certainty outcome, everystates president, swing states, runoff elections .run off elections means basically there will never be a blow out in the voting polls it will always be competitive with that being said with the presidents trying to run for president they will actually try to reach the peoples needs to meet there satisfactory. The swing states are saying that there one state isn't going to decide the whole election."
"This article is about a small town near the French and Swiss borders its name is Vauban. Vauban ha a unique community they have no cars!. yeah, that's right no cars there is a no automobile law in this small town which makes a lot of people like the mother of two ms. Hadron Walter. She says that she is ""much happier this way because when I had a car I was always tense"". People could walk down the street and not worry about whether or not a person is going to lose control of their car and smash into them or even worse."
"In 2006 the United States and other areas started to try these things, and they called it ""smart planning"". Car ownership is allowed, but there are only two parking areas-large garages at the edge of the development where a car-owner buys a space for $40,000, along with a home. Vauban, home to 5,500 residents within a rectangular square mile, is the most advanced experiment in low car suburban life. ""All of our development since World War II has been centered on the car, and that will have to change,"" said David Goldberg."
"To the senator of Florida,"
"I believe that the electoral college should be abolished. The system is unjust and prevents we, the people to have our individual voices heard. When Americans vote they're supposedly voting for the next president, when indeed they're votes only sway the opinion of the elector."
"Think back to a little over a decade ago, to the 2000 presidential elections. Al Gore received the popular vote, meaning that he was the one that us, the Americans had wanted. Due to the fact that George W. Bush, his rival, received more electoral votes, Bush won, leaving an unflavored president running the country. According to source 2, a Gallup poll was taken shortly after Gore had lost the presidency, an entire 60 percent of voters would prefer to have a direct vote, rather than go through the electoral process."
"Granted, that the electoral college does give a certainty of outcome and that no region on its own can vote for a president, it does give an equal chance for everybody to have their mostly preferred president (according to source 3), there are however some flaws to these so-called ""pros"". Faithless electors exist. These electors totally ignore what the people have to say and cast their own vote. This occurred in the 1960s with Hawaii and Louisiana, and when vice president Nixon validated only his opponents electors, he made sure to do so without ""establishing a president"", though it can happen again."
"We should all agree with Nixon, carter, and dole on the fact that this system isn't fair. Our voices as individuals aren't heard, and we just vote for the state of electors. We, the people of the United States of America wish to do away with the electoral college."
Some schools require summer projects for students. Just to assure students are to continue learning throughout their summer break. Many argue if the summer projects should be teacher-designed or student-designed. The schools that require summer projects should have their projects be teacher-designed for many various reasons.
Although many others think that the summer projects should be student-designed. Those would think that since it's a project to do over the summer;many students should have a say. Their own choice to choose what should be done for their project and how it should be done. That would be giving them the opportunity for them to do something and be able to start from the beginning with it. Though with it being student-deigned it would bring many problems.
"The teachers would give the students an objective or task for the project. They would have to know what the objective is to know what is needed to be learned for this summer project. The student can be specified to knowing what could be done once knowing the objective of the project. Once the objective is giving to them, they get a better understanding and knowledge of what is need to learn for their summer project."
Then teachers would also give many sorts of examples to the students. Giving the students examples of the project will help them get a better understanding of how it should be done. Once the students gets a better knowledge of what do to for their project when examples are given to them. Examples given to the students should have them thinking how they should start their summer project and start to wonder what it should be based off.
Lastly the teacher would tell them what is required or needed for their summer project. The whole point of a summer project is to assure students continue their learning over break. The teachers could give the students a requirement that has them learn many things that can be presented in their summer projects. That would be assuring that students continue learning during their summer break. The teachers would be able to know if they learned something over their summer break.
"In conclusion, summer school projects should be teacher-designed. The students are given requirements, objectives and examples for the project by the teachers. With the requirements and objectives students can start to begin their projects with an understanding of what is needed to learn. Students would still get a say in what they would like to do for their summer project though. It wouldn't be as freely to say the project is student-designed. Having the summer projects teacher-designed would make it easier for many students as well.  "
The Face of the Alien on Mars
"Have you ever Wonder what the face on Mars is? I have, and I'm here to tell you about what I know about this face or piece of land on Mars. Would you disc rice the land to be something the alien's made? Well working with NASA has thought me some things. And I will tell you what this face on Mars is now let's get started."
"We found out that the face is just a landmark of Mars it's not a face. The way the clouds were facing, and the shadowing made it look like a face. And Now that we know it's not something another race made we don't have to worry as much. We also know that we took that photo in 1976 and again in 1998. We have improved our cameras by a good amount since the last time we took it. Then when we took it in 2001 the image was much clearer, and we could see the photo."
"From the text it says that we took 3 photos of the site as year's went on. In fact, we didn't have high-resolution or 3D image's back then. So we didn't really have the technology back then, and now we do. Sending another robot take's year's to get to Mars and time, taking photo's that is another problem. Now that we have better technology for this we can take better picture's."
To explain this the cameras that we had back then really didn't have good pile resolution. So we really couldn't get a good picture to capture this exciting moment of history. Plus we can now get excited about our trip to Mars later on. And we know what to expect a little. They said that we would take off to Mars in 2020 or around that time. And we need trained and willing people to take on the mission.
"Now to sum this all up into one paragraph, ok let's see if I can do it. The face of the Alien on Mars really is a landmark not really an alien. By the look of the picture, the weather during the shot of the photo had dust and other partial's that were in the way. And the shadow's made it look like it was a face. And when we attempt to reach Mars in 2020 we know what to expect when the day comes. I hope you enjoyed reading this as much as I enjoyed typing it. Hope that you learned something from this. And I hope you have a good day and I will see you in the next one.  "
"The Seagoing Cowboys program is an amazing opportunity. You get to help people in need, and you get the added bonus of having fun and sightseeing on the trip. If you are looking for work, this would be an amazing job that will change your life forever. You will need to put in hard work and dedication, but this job is worth it all."
"Another reason to be a Seagoing Cowboy is that you will be doing a good service. You will be helping countries and the people inhabiting them. For example, ""To help these countries recover their food supplies, animals..."" This is a valid reason why you should join Seagoing Cowboys. Not a lot of people get the chance to help an entire nation by bringing them cattle, mules, horses, and food. If you are worried that you will not get any free time, don't be. You get to sightseer whenever you land in port and experience very amazing places and things such as the Acropolis in Greece, and taking a gondola ride in Venice, Italy. An excerpt from the article ""A Cowboy Who Rode the Waves"" would be ""Besides helping people, you have the side benefit of seeing Europe and China."" Another benefit of being a Seagoing Cowboy is that it opens your eyes to needs in certain poor countries, or countries devastated by disaster. In addition to that, you have to put in a lot of hard work and dedication to feed and take care of the animals onboard the boat. But ""Being a Seagoing Cowboy is the opportunity of a lifetime."""
"That is why you should participate in the Seagoing Cowboy program. It is completely worth it, and you will come back from this amazing experience more aware of what needs to be done to help people in other countries. Being a Seagoing Cowboy is a great opportunity that you will treasure for the rest of your life."
Cell phones we all have them and everyone knows we do. We take to school when we know we should not. The school policy I believe we should have is policy 2. There are many reasons why we should not bring our cell phones to distract students and no one really knows who we could be texting or what we are texting.
"One of the reasons we should not have our cell phones is because we could be distracting someone such as a teacher even though we could only use our phones during our free time we could be texting someone in a classroom who is learning and trying to focus on the lesson, but they can not because someone is texting them."
"Another reason we should not have cell phones is because of texting. Texting yes we could text on our free time but what if I have friend who is in Math class while I have free time and suppose that my friend is taking a test today, and she asked me if I could text her the answers would it be another form of cheating and cheating on a test is big it would not be right to allow us to bring cell phones when we are going to use them to cheat on our tests."
These are just some reasons why we should not allow cell phone to school even if it is during our free time. There are consequent when we bring our cell phones to school these phones are useful but outside of school but at school what we need them for nothing but distract student from there work.
"Several people in the United States do not participate in extracurricular activities. Most of them sit at home, play video games, and don't do much in the community. They basically only come in contact with other people at school. But what if these activities where required? Required extracurricular activities would allow them to be communicating with other people all the time, not just at school. I think required extracurricular activities are a fabulous idea because they build friendships, keep students active, and progress social skills."
"First, after school programs let you see your friends and possibly make new ones. This will help strengthen the relationship between you and your friends. Also, when participating in extracurricular activities, you meet all sorts of new people. I know when I played basketball, I met several new people from other schools, and I know a lot of the players from other schools now. It got me in public more often, and that's better for you than staying home watching screens all day."
"Secondly, I think that extracurricular activities are good for keeping people active. For example, if you chose basketball as you after school activity, you would be running in practice, going up and down the court during games, and that would lead you to getting in better shape. They would also stay active in the community, because several of the activities involve people in the community. Things such as sporting events would involve crowds of people coming to watch and support their teams. In addition, being active and playing sport would help lower obesity, which is starting to be a problem in some schools. The running and jumping, and just getting up and doing things after school help you lose weight."
"Thirdly, these activities would build social skills, as being out in public surrounded by other people force you to talk, and slowly build social skills. Social skills are used for everything in life, from making friends to getting a job. They are extremely useful for doing anything in life. Going back to making friends, these skills will make it a million times easier to do so, because communication would come naturally, and you would seem more friendly. And since most of these activities involve being in the community more often and meeting new people, it doesn't hurt to have this particular set of skills."
"Lastly, I believe that I have proven that required extracurricular activities are useful, productive, and better for you than laying in bed or watching television. They develop friendships, keep you active, and produce social skills. Making friends in life is important, and after school programs help you make some lifelong accomplices. The social skills you learn might help you get a future job, and will most definitely help you with life in general. I hope many people view required activities differently, and will see the reason behind them."
Dear principal I agree with you with the extracurriculars. Because someone might be interested in that curricular and extracurriculars will help getting the right job like being a R&B sing.
"A way that students need extracurricular activities is that someone might enjoy it. For an example when I joined Lego league. I Diana´NT know what to expect when I joined the league. When I got there every thing changed for me. That there was Lego and robots my two favorite things and I made friends during my time in Lego league. Even though it took a lot of programming, but I enjoy my self while I was there."
"Another way that students need extracurriculars activates is that it will help them get the right job. For an example if you wanted to be a singer when you grow up you would join the middle and high school quire then join America got talent. Then get your first ever record deal. Next go to the record company and once you're in you sing to them get your album. Then you can be in music videos, talk shows, cartoons, TV shows, and being famous."
In conclusion that is why extracurriculars activities are important to students no matter what.
"Dear Principal,"
My name is STUDENT_NAME and I would like to explain to you why I think it would be a good idea to make only people with B averages be allowed to play sports or activities.
"Many students in our school have a C average. Which means that a lot of people in the school could not play any sports or activities. I understand your reasons for why you would like students who have a B average to participate, and I strongly agree."
"First, in my opinion, if you cannot get your homework in on time, how could you also have extra time to play a sport, nonetheless an activity. Some parents tell there children ""school comes first."""
"I do not believe that you can put your full effort into a sport or activity if you cannot even get your homework in on time. I understand some people may have been gone a day or week, but they will be excused and have extra time to do that assignment."
"Next, you might be the kind of person who might not study, well, with this new school policy, more students might be encouraged to do so, and take some time out of there spare time and study which will help them out in the long run. Plus, this makes the children want it more, so, they might try harder."
"As you can tell, I think that the new school policy is a great idea. With this rule, it will hopefully make students to be more responsible and focused. In addition, it's not incredibly hard to even get a B average. I am an A average student, and it's not the end of the world if you study before a test or turn in your homework."
"Sincerely your student, STUDENT_NAME"
Dear principal
I think that you should require students to perform community service.
It will help all elementary school students to do better on their school work. You can let students that are interested in this program to participate in it.
"Students that do not want to participate, must let them do what they want.
"
Principal I will be part of this program and I will help those elementary school students.
You still have to ask the students that are interested if this program will affect their grades in school.
I will help you organize this program.
I will also bring as many tutors as possible.
"Furthermore, I will try to make this program successful.
"
Many other students and parents are going to help us organize this program.
This program is going to help educate many elementary school students and make a good future for them.
I will do my best to make those students successful.
You should announce this program to the whole school so many people can participate.
We need as many students as possible.
Helping people is one of my hobbies.
We can also provide different interesting stuff that students can do during tutoring time.
We can provide sports and other things that they want.
"Furthermore, we can make it as an after school program.
"
"Furthermore, we should also provide buses to people that are going to stay.
"
Mr. Principal let me handle this program and make it ready for all students.
We should do our best to help those kids.
Parents can also help.
You can also ask for donations.
Mr. principal it's my pleasure to help all students that need help.
Sincerely: your student

"The humanity now in days had been not so good lately, there are many opinions on how you should do things in life or how you should act. It is well-informed that people can be complicated, but nobody will say the life will be easy all the time. I think people should start making their own decision because, they can learn about life, have a better understanding on how life works and how to value their-self and be efficient person on their own."
"However, there is a big chance that people can tell you how you really should live your life, you have to experienced it in persons there will be a day when you are going to fall or something can happen you are not aware on how life can be so hard and difficult in times. Also, mistakes are allowed nobody is perfect life will surprise you anytime without you notice it you got to be ready to face it not matter how easy or hard it could be. When you make your owns decision you will be capable of making the right decision for yourself."
"Meanwhile, it is hard to understand life sometimes but is part of our daily life, and you have to understand how it really works so the way you do not stress out for a simple thing, life gives you challenges that only you as the only responsible for yourself have to face it and all will depend how you take things it will be a result of it. As we grow life will make us stronger or weak it all depends but best choice of making the right thing is that you should be aware that anything can happen without given you a hint it will hit you on the right time or not on the best time you wanted it. Anything that will hurt you will make you strong and that's how you know that you are living life."
"Lastly, people might not notice it but if we do not love ourselves anybody will do it, people do have to depend on some else to be happy it's all about you. In addition, anything you do will not make others happy you have to learn to do everything on your own because that more efficient you are the more good things in life you will make. Be your own and value every single thing that is around, but remember nothing is easy life can surprise you anytime."
"In conclusion, people should start making their own decisions to be aware of what life really is if your learned and have a better understanding about life in a daily routine anything that will happen will not surprise you. Loving yourself will make you love others. Hopefully people will take a note that life is all about you and not others each person has a different thoughts and ways of seen life."
"Cars, a right and a way of transportation that we as people of the untied states have, used by many as a source of going from point a to point b. But if while going to those places you realized you where just killing the earth every mile at a time. Cars give off gas that pollutes the air and harms us, and begins to create green house gases. Over time these gases could do very harmful things to us. The solution isn't as simple as everyone in the world giving up there car, But what if there is a long term solution to fix this big problem."
