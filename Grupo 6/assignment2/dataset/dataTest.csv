"The Face on Mars is nothing but a natural occurrence. On Mars, there are things called a battle or mesa. Which in fact, is what this ""face"" really is. I know this because in the article, that was based off NASA's own research, ""Unmasking the Face on Mars"" it says, ""What the picture actually shows is the martian equivalent of a battle or mesa-landforms common around the American West."" We have these landforms on our very own planet, so its understandable as to how we can recognize one on another planet.",0
"On top of that, we used top quality equipment to study and research the Face on Mars. This is backed up by how in the article it says, ""Mars Global Surveyor drew close enough for a second look. 'We had to roll the spacecraft 25 degrees to center the face in the field of view,' said Gavin. 'Main's team captured an extraordinary photo using the camera's absolute maximum resolution.' Each pixel in the 2001 image spans 1.56 meters, compared to 43 meters per pixel in the best 1976 photo.""",0
"In the article itself it even says that the face is no alien monument. ""Thousands of anxious web surfers were waiting when the image first appeared on a JPL website, revealing... a natural landform. There was no alien monument after all."" With all that being said, with all the proof NASA gathered, it's impossible for the ""Face on Mars"" to be anything but a natural occurrence.",0
"Students have a higher chance of catching a virus during school hours. Viruses could easily spread to others by touching or any other types of physical interactions. It's not easy to cure a virus and some viruses could be deadly, like the Coronavirus. A lot of people, mostly students in Wuhan, China are getting this virus and most of them claim it spread through physical interaction. The virus is spreading quickly, and now we have many cases and few deaths in the U.S. Even though it is very important to be interacting with other students when you are in school, a single touch could possibly harm you. Some people believe that distance learning is not beneficial since students need to interact with others; However, being able to attend classes from home is a huge advantage and a good way for students to avoid catching any type of virus.",0
"Many schools offer distance learning only for students who need it. Some schools offer it as an option for students who want to attend classes from home. Students can easily attend school classes either online or by video conferencing. One of the advantages of distance learning is that, students are not going to wait on their buses early in the morning when its cold, foggy, and rainy. Instead, they will be sitting at home feeling cozy and safe while doing their school work. However, in winter, when students enter the school building it's usually very warm and when they leave it's freezing outside, so they end up catching a cold. That leads to parents having to spend money and take their children to the hospital. In the hospital there are many sick people around, so students could catch viruses easily. Distance learning could also help parents save up money and not having to worry about taking their kids to the hospital because students are less likely to get sick and catch a cold when they are at home.",0
"Since the Coronavirus is made out of many viruses and germs joined together, being outside when its cold or being around many students could be dangerous. One way for students to prevent themselves from catching this virus is by washing their hands all the time. Because this virus could also spread through droplets when coughing or sneezing. Students always forget to wash their hands after they cough and when they touch other students they spread germs. Parents, however, are always reminding their children to wash their hands before doing anything. When students attend classes from home they are spending more time with their parents. Therefore, students will always be reminded to wash their hands. That way they will be safe and prevented from catching or spreading any germs.",0
"In conclusion, distance learning or attending classes from home is a beneficial advantage for students to look forward into. It's not only a good way to protect students from catching or spreading deadly viruses, It will also help parents spend less money when it comes to hospital bills and school supplies such as backpacks and books. Also, Students are going to be around their family and pets which means they are going to feel more happy doing their school work. They are not going to sit around watching the clock waiting to go home because they are going to be already home. By staying home and attending classes at home, students aren't going to be catching diseases and then spreading to other people. Clearly, they aren't going to be harmed or harm people. Distance learning is the best start that that will take us to the solution to those deadly problems.",0
"Driverless cars have good and bad things that would go along with them. From my perspective though I believe that we could go without them. Cars that can drive themselves not only puts the one driving in danger but anyone around the car. Having driverless cars just makes us lazy, if we can not drive a car. Driverless cars should not be something we should invest our money into.",0
Cars that can drive themselves is a very dangerous and scary idea. A big machine that is operating itself around others that are doing the exact thing is not a good idea. Very many mechanical mishaps could happen easily to cause the car to do things it wasn't made to do. If an animal or a person would happen to jump in the street would the car be able to detect that and stop the car before something very bad was to happen?,0
Having driverless cars puts a bad message on us. Having driverless cars would mean we don't want to drive or are too tried to drive or just to lazy. I think that this would make the United States look bad if we were to happen to get driverless cars.,0
"Driverless cars may save us money individual but over all as a country I think we could lose money. Driverless cars have so many sensors and devices that would need to be installed and would have to be manufactured which causes a lot of money. ""These smart road systems worked surprisingly well, but they required massive upgrades to existing roads, something that was simply too expensive to be practical."" This was stated to show that these sensors and things that are needed to manufacture these cars are more expensive than they should be. This is why I think driverless cars are a bad idea.",0
Some people might think that traveling in a group led by a tour guide is a good way. Others might say that it is not.,1
"I agree with this statement. If you are traveling by yourself, you might want to consider traveling with a guide who is experienced in the area you plan to visit. A good guide can help you make the most of your trip.",1
"How many of us students want to be forced to do something? Probably not many. But, if it is for a good outcome, then maybe we should take into consideration that an extracurricular activity at school can be quite useful for the majority of us. If activities such as sports, performing and visual arts, and technologically focused ideas are available, then many of our students would be intrigued with doing the activities that have been provided from our school principal and other faculty members. Since the decision has been made for all the students to participate in at least one extracurricular activity from the principal, then maybe the decision for bringing new activities along with it will also be approved as well.",0
"In the school that I am currently attending as of today, sports are an huge interest for quite a bit of students. Football, baseball, field hockey, and softball are just some of the sports that are mentioned from the different athletes that are streaming through the school's hallways every single day. Yes, there are already students doing sports anyway, but there are some students who have the perfect capabilities to do them, but they just do not put full effort into doing the sports. There are already plenty of different sport related activities through the schools, and it would be easy for these students to be included in doing the sport that they would be interested in, but all it takes is determination and full-on effort to make it happen.",0
"With the already large number of performing and visually artistic students in the building, there are many opportunities that newcomers may be able to do if they are just starting out. In the building we have a choral teacher, a drama teacher, and 2 art teachers, who are all extremely helpful, and are there for any questions that a curious student may have about the fine arts community and how to get interested. If more people get interested every year, then I am sure that making more activities that involve the community will be less of a challenge for the principal, and for others who are putting in to create ideas. If more students consider being in the fine arts community, then that would be a successful achievement for the school itself and our work may be recognized by even more people outside the school as well.",0
"In the day and age that we are all in as of right now, technology is at its finest point in time. With the addition of iPhone's, iPad's, Microsoft computers, and many more devices beyond that, we all have the ability to create different ideas and to make different extracurricular activities for all the students who are interested in doing things with technology. As technology does grow every day, so should the amount of activities that we can do with it as well. Many students are in fact somewhat involved with technology and if the opportunity came along for them to have an in-school interaction with it, then they would maybe have a new hobby or a new interest that could help them in their own lives.",0
"In conclusion, I do standby my principal's decision to have every student be involved in an extracurricular activity and I see why he is making it that way. If we add the activities such as sports, performing and visual arts, and technologically focused ideas to the mix, then we will have a great lineup of the activities that the students can do. In the long run, these activities may end up doing well for us all, and they could even put a great impression on our school.",0
"In the past few years, cellphones have become a major use of communication for many people. Cellphone has become a major issue in the field of driving. Many people drive while they're on the cellphone. The use of cellphones while driving should be banned. I say this because there have been 60-70% of drivers that have died, crashed due to the fact that they are using their cellphones while driving.",0
"To begin with, the use of cellphones while driving should be stopped. In the last few years there have been many car crashes because people are all into their phones when they overall focus should be driving. At times cellphones can be of good use. But not all the time. People use cellphones to help them get to and from, but they shouldn't be used all the time.",0
"According to the law of Tennessee, ""banning hand-held cellphone use while driving takes effect July 1"". ""Beginning July 1, the drivers could face a major fine up to $200 for using their cellphones while driving"". This should be banned in the state of Georgia, because the drivers don't realize how much damage they're causing when they are on their cellphones.",0
"In conclusion, cellphones should be banned. They should not be used while driving. If people want to avoid getting into accidents they should stop using their phones while driving. If there weren't any accidents the world would be a safer place. Having cellphones can be of good use as well. But only if people use them that way. Making a phone call while driving can be dangerous as well. Making phone calls aren't always that important. So banning cellphones while driving could result in a better solution.  ",0
"Cell phones have become an essential tool for communication in our daily lives. However, when it comes to using them while driving, it's a topic of much debate. Some people argue that drivers should be able to use their cell phones in certain circumstances, while others believe that it's too risky and could lead to accidents. In my opinion, drivers should not be able to use cell phones in any capacity while operating a vehicle.",1
"Firstly, using a cell phone while driving is a major distraction. When we are behind the wheel, our focus should be on the road and the other cars around us. If we are busy texting, calling, or browsing social media, we are taking our eyes off the road and our hands off the wheel. This increases the chances of getting into an accident, which could not only harm us but also other innocent people. According to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, distracted driving was responsible for 3,166 deaths in the United States in 2017. This is a staggering number and proves that distracted driving is a serious issue that needs to be addressed.",1
"Secondly, using a cell phone while driving impairs our reaction time. When we are driving, we need to be able to react quickly to unexpected situations. For example, if a pedestrian suddenly steps into the road, we need to be able to hit the brakes immediately. However, if we are busy with our cell phone, we might not be able to react as quickly, which could result in a tragic accident. Our reaction time is critical when it comes to driving, and using a cell phone compromises that.",1
"Thirdly, there are many other ways to communicate while driving that are safer than using a cell phone. For example, we can use hands-free devices, such as Bluetooth headsets, to take calls and communicate with others. We can also use voice-to-text features to send messages or make calls without having to physically handle our phones. These alternatives allow us to communicate safely while still keeping our eyes on the road and our hands on the wheel.",1
"Lastly, setting a good example is important. As drivers, we have a responsibility to set a good example for other drivers and pedestrians. If we use our cell phones while driving, we are sending a message that it's okay to do so, which could encourage other drivers to do the same. This could lead to a culture of distracted driving, which would be detrimental to road safety.",1
"In conclusion, using a cell phone while driving is a risky behavior that can lead to accidents and fatalities. It's important that we prioritize road safety and avoid distractions while driving. There are safer alternatives available, such as hands-free devices and voice-to-text features, which allow us to communicate without compromising our safety. As drivers, we have a responsibility to set a good example and promote safe driving practices. Therefore, drivers should not be able to use cell phones in any capacity while operating a vehicle.",1
"Hey there!  So, you know, making decisions in life can be super tough. Like, there are so many things to consider, and it's hard to know what's best. But, I think it's really important to listen to both your heart and mind when making choices.",1
"Like, your heart can tell you what you really want and what makes you happy, but your mind can help you figure out how to make it happen. It's like, they're both trying to tell you what to do, but in different ways. And, you know, it's important to listen to both of them because they're both important.",1
"But, sometimes, people can be really negative and try to bring you down. They might be like, ""Oh, you're never going to make it."" Or, ""That's not going to work."" And, it's easy to get caught up in that and start feeling like you can't do things. But, you have to ignore that stuff. Like, you have to have faith in yourself and your ideas, even if other people don't.",1
"So, how do you stay motivated and ignore the negativity? Well, I think it's important to set goals for yourself and work towards them. Like, if you want to start a business, you have to start taking steps towards making it happen. And, you have to be willing to learn and take risks. It's not going to be easy, but it'll be worth it in the end.",1
"And, it's also important to surround yourself with people who support you and believe in you. Like, if you're trying to start a band, you want people who are going to be like, ""Yeah, you can do it!"" And, not try to bring you down.",1
"So, in conclusion, listening to your heart and mind when making decisions and staying motivated to achieve success can be really hard, but it's important to do it. You have to ignore the negativity and keep going. And, it's okay to ask for help and support along the way. Thanks for reading!",1
"In my op pinon school is good how it is now. Having go to go school for a couple of months straight across and then just have a couple of months off for summer. If they were to change the school routine to kids having to have breaks for 3-4 week's they wouldn't come back with the same effort as they do when they come back off of summer break. For example if I were to leave school for 3-4 weeks I wouldn't want to come back to the same classes and with the same routine, It's just that Students do retain the information they teach they would have to go over it just so they get back on track. But the fact of having year-around school isn't it just doesn't make a difference. And I'm a sure that kids wouldn't like to have only 3-4 weeks off school after all the time they spend in school",0
This is why students should have a right amount of school and a certain amount of months off. A year-around school benefits teachers not students. Because they if they did have a year-around teachers wouldn't have to worry about reteaching it again to the students because they would expect them to already know what they are taking about. So they should have a regular schedule for the schools board to follow.,0
"But at the same time the fact of not having to go to school for weeks sounds good. When their break is over they would have to go back to school not only that, but they would have to pick up from where the left off at first. I feel like leaving in the middle of a lesson that is important that really wouldn't have the students as much. If they were to change the school routine it would just mess things up with the students and their grades and that would e more work of teachers. What if some important test is coming up for the students, and they only have a certain amount of time to get things done within the time period, and then they would leave on break what if the teacher couldn't get everything done in time then the whole class would fail the test.",0
"This is why they should just leave school as it is just so that student's and teacher's wouldn't have to go through tall that trouble, Just get what they need to get done within the time they are their and then when they are done with all the work they needed to get done with they could leave for summer break, just so students don't stress over the facts that they have to get things done in a certain about of time. These are some of the many reasons why they should have school for months and not take breaks in between school days just so that they have months off on their summer break.",0
"Researching the pros and cons of accelerated high school experiences has become increasingly relevant for today’s teens. Students who have accelerated their high school experience and succeeded, and those who have failed, have provided valuable case studies and insights into the challenges armed, and unprepared students can face. ",1
"Successful students have often cited the acceleration of their high school experience as providing them with an opportunity to get ahead in college before their peers. For instance, students who graduate early may be able to begin college with a major or focus on a field of study before other students who are just entering college. On the other hand however, unprepared and ill-advised students who have accelerated their high school experience have found themselves facing difficulties, such as ill-preparedness for college level classes, struggling to make friends, and missing out on high school experiences and events.",1
"It is important to consider these implications for the future of education, and ensure that adolescents are properly informed and advised when considering accelerating their high school experience. With the right knowledge, support, and preparation, these students can tap into the opportunities that accelerated high school can provide, while avoiding the pitfalls of inexperience and insufficient preparation.",1
"Why should anyone want to have a car drive you anywhere you want to go when you can drive yourself? You should be the one in control of the car not the other way around, there could be a malfunction with the car that might cause a break, and they don't need more technology to a car, because at the end of the day you're not going to have it all of your life. I'm against having the Google car, because who needs a literally has laser beams that comes out of the top of the car to form a constantly updating 3-D model of the cars surroundings.",0
"You should be the one in control of the car at all times. A person learns how to drive for a reason. They learn how to drive, so that their parents don't have to anymore, to maybe go places by yourself, and just to see how well you have learned to drive and how much you have improved before you started to drive in the first place. Having a human drive you are better than a robot driving you because you have an advantage of learning and continuing how to learn how.",0
"Having malfunctions is a big problem. There is a lot that can happen to you if you manage to mess something up or if you just crash and wreak your car. You can push a button that can do some serious harm to you or anyone that is in the car at the time, you can break some bones by cracking into another car or a tree, and it can make you have some type of brain damage. Having malfunctions are bad, but dying in the process of your vehicle having a malfunction is horrible.",0
"You're not always going to have that car all of you life. You might sell it, pass it down to one of your kids, or just leave it on the side of the road. I don't know what you would do with it. Not everybody has had a car the have had all of their life that would be a big problem in having it all your life. Having a Google car isn't always going to be there.",0
"I will not agree for having a Google car, but if I did, i couldn't possibly let it drive for me. I would be the one to drive it at all times.",0
"Driverless cars may seem like a cool new innovation that take the stress away from driving. The truth is that while there are many positive things about driverless cars there are still many complications with introducing them into society. Without a driver, the mechanics could malfunction and cause a safety threat to other drivers and pedestrians. Many states also have laws against even testing driverless cars. Even thought the car can do the basic driving by itself, the human passengers still need to take control for more complicated road conditions. The production and use of driverless cars is negative to society because they pose a safety threat, force laws to change, and they still require human control.",0
"Safety is always a concern when dealing with any type of motor vehicle and driverless cars increase the risk of safety because they do not have human control. Every state has road laws that every driver is meant to follow. Traffic laws assume that, ""the only safe car has a human driver in control at all times""(""Driverless Cars Are Coming""). This evidence states how the laws believe that a car is only safe when there is a human controlling it. These laws are meant to promote safety and since they state a human needs to be in control for a vehicle to be safe, then driverless cars are not the best thing for safety. This is negative because when there is a larger safety risk, more people may be fatally injured and the public will feel unsafe. The use of driverless cars on the road would require the laws to be modified and allow their use.",0
"Another way that driverless cars are negative to society is that they would force the laws to change to accommodate them. All over the country there are laws in place that prohibit the use of driverless cars. According to the article ""Driverless Cars Are Coming"", ""in most states it is illegal even to test computer-driven cars"". Since driverless cars are illegal in most states, in order for them to be used on the roads all the laws relevant to this topic would need to be changed or adjusted. Changing the laws is negative because changing the already safe laws could cause the public to be unsafe and the process for changing the laws is a castle. It needs to be sent in and approved by many government branches and could be rejected by anyone, causing the process to repeat. Not only is it a castle and burden, it is also taking a lot of time. Even if the laws are changed the cars still require human involvement",0
"Driverless cars may seem more convenient but in reality they require human interaction in any tough traffic situation. As a result this is negative because it is not improving the convenience for drivers. Some say that driverless cars are more convenient, but in fact they can only perform the easy aspects of driving without the aid from the human driver. Driverless cars ""can steer, accelerate, and brake themselves, but all are designed to notify the driver when the road ahead requires human skills, such as navigating through work zones and around accidents. This means the human driver must remain alert and be ready to take over when the situation requires human skills""(""Driverless Cars Are Coming""). This evidence shows how involved humans have to be in a ""driverless"" car. An invention that seems convenient actually requires the driver to be more alert, so they know when they need to step in to control the car in difficult situations. This is negative because waiting for difficult road conditions can cause a driver to be more stressed and anxious than they would be if they were normally driving a car. Since the driver needs to more alert and the fact that driverless cars are not that convenient at all there is no reason for them to be on the roads.",0
"In conclusion, driverless cars should not be produced and driven on the roads because they pose a safely threat to the public, they require the laws to change, and they still need human interaction and therefore are not a convenience. Considering this, is it really worth all the risk and castle just for something ""cool"" to be on the road? Would it still be cool if these vehicles endangered you or a family member?",0
"Dear Senator,",1
I am writing to you today to express my support for abolishing the Electoral College. The Electoral College is an outdated and undemocratic system that has no place in the 21st century. It is time for us to elect our president by popular vote.,1
"There are many reasons why the Electoral College is a flawed system. First, it gives more power to voters in small states than voters in large states. In a state like Wyoming, for example, a single vote is worth three times as much as a vote in California. This is because each state has two senators, regardless of population, and each state has a number of electors equal to the number of its representatives in Congress plus its two senators. This means that a voter in Wyoming has 3.7 times as much power as a voter in California in choosing the president.",1
"Second, the Electoral College can lead to results that do not reflect the will of the people. In 2000, for example, Al Gore won the popular vote but lost the election to George W. Bush. This was because Bush won more electoral votes, even though Gore won more votes nationwide. This has happened four other times in our history, and it is a clear sign that the Electoral College is not a fair system.",1
"Third, the Electoral College encourages candidates to focus their campaigns on a handful of ""battleground"" states. These are states where the outcome of the election is uncertain, and they are the only states where candidates spend any time campaigning. This means that voters in other states are essentially ignored by the candidates, which is not fair to them.",1
"Finally, the Electoral College is a relic of a bygone era. It was created in a time when the United States was a very different country. The Founding Fathers were worried that a popular vote for president would give too much power to the large states, so they created the Electoral College as a way to protect the interests of the small states. However, this is no longer a valid concern. The United States is now a much more populous country, and the small states are no longer at a disadvantage.",1
"In conclusion, the Electoral College is an outdated and undemocratic system that has no place in the 21st century. It is time for us to elect our president by popular vote. This would be a fair and just system that would give all voters a voice.",1
Thank you for your time.,1
"Sincerely,",1
[Your Name],1
"When electing the President of the United States, you must vote in favor of the president you want. However, instead of coming down to popular vote, the system uses the Electrolux College to decide. The Electoral Vote works in that the people of a certain states votes for their candidate and the majority of people who vote for a certain president give their votes to a slate of voters. What this means is that the popular vote within a state wins the electoral votes of the electors who then vote for the president. Many people dislike this system including myself. I disprove of this system because it limits representation, permits the disinterest of voters, and reduces a candidates interest in a state.",0
"One major problem with the Electoral College voting system is that it limits representation of the people. The Electoral College votes work so that the population of a state directly effects the amount of votes that states receives. For example, Wyoming only has about 500,000 voters so it only receives one electoral college vote. Because there is only one vote for Wyoming, the 500,000 voters do not have accurate representation in a vote that has a total of 270 electoral votes. There have also been times in which a president has won the popular vote but lost the Electoral College vote. This was seen in the 2000 vote of Bush versus Gore when Gore won the popular vote and Bush won the electoral vote.",0
"One might claim that because the amount of electoral votes for a state is based of the population, it is fair. However, I believe that the popular vote is more fair because it expresses the opinion of the majority. In some states, there is a large majority of people running for a single party. This can be observed primarily in Texas where an overwhelming majority of voters are Republican. Therefore, the Republican president wins Texas almost every election period. This can be frustrating for Democrats who live in Texas because they know that their vote does not matter causing them to lose interest in voting in the first place. This is not fair for those people nor is it particularly good to express as an American trait.",0
"As stated before, the larger the population of a state, the more Electoral College votes that state gets. This leads to a small group of ""big states"" that have such a large amount of votes, they are the target for candidates to try to persuade to vote for them. On the opposite side of the spectrum, most of the other 50 states have a smaller amount of votes and are less of an objective for candidates to acquire. In many states throughout an election period (the period in which candidates move to different states giving speeches) the candidates never make an appearance in their state at all. This is observed in the 2000 election in which seventeen states did not have the candidate make an appearance at all. This also can lower interest in voting for the president.",0
"The Electoral college voting system is not fair in the way the present system works. The system does not show proper representation of the people, does not promote interest in voting, and causes a candidate to ignore the states in which do not have a large amount of electoral votes. Moving to popular vote will fix all of these problems and will improve the way we vote for our president.",0
" Completing high school one year early can seem like a great opportunity for students to start their careers and gain experience. However, it is important to consider the benefits of completing the traditional four years of high school before moving on to college. In this essay, we will explore the reasons why it is better to finish high school in the traditional manner.",1
"Firstly, completing the four years of high school allows students to prepare more for college. This time can be used to reflect on one's interests and career goals, and to take the necessary steps to achieve them. For example, the four years of high school helped me to discover my passion for a particular field and to work towards it. It also helped me to become more mature and prepared for the next step.",1
"Secondly, it is too early for students to finish high school at the age of 15-17. At this age, students may not be fully ready to take on the responsibilities of college life. They may not have had enough time to mature and develop the skills necessary to succeed in college. For example, my younger brother is 16 and is currently a junior in high school. When we have nothing to do or are having a conversation, I always ask him if he is ready to go to college, and his response is that he is not even ready for his senior year. I understand his perspective, as I was his age when I was a junior.",1
"Finally, students may not have had enough education to succeed in college. Completing four years of high school allows students to gain the necessary knowledge and skills to excel in college. If students graduate early, they may be at a disadvantage in college, as they may not have had enough time to fully understand the material. For example, I have heard from some friends in college that they struggled in certain classes, even though they graduated from high school at 18. This suggests that if students graduate early, they may not have had enough time to fully understand the material.",1
"In conclusion, completing high school in the traditional manner has many benefits. It allows students to prepare more for college, it is not too early for students to finish high school, and it allows students to gain the necessary education to succeed in college. High school is a crucial step in one's life, and completing it in the traditional manner can set the stage for success in the future.",1
"Studying Venus is a worthy pursuit despite its dangers. The author has a few reasons of why he thinks this. Some of them are to find out what it is made up of. Another one is to try and find out why there is no life on Mars. Also even though he thinks they should explore it he talks about the dangers and how really dangerous it is. There are a lot of risks to exploring Venus, but it would be worth it.",0
One thing that the author does well to support his idea is he gives a lot of compelling reasons of why he this Venus is worth exploring. One of the reasons why he thinks its worth exploring is because they can find out what Venus is made up of by taking rock samples. I think this is a good reason because it explains how the author wants to explore Venus despite its dangers. Another reason why he thinks it should be explored despite its dangers is because they can figure out why there is no life on Venus. I also think this is a good reason because it proves why Venus should be explored even though it is dangerous according to the author.,0
In conclusion the author has a good point of why Venus should be explored despite the dangers. One of his reasons is to find out why there is no life on Venus. Another reason is to find out what Venus is made up of. I think these are good supporting reasons because they prove why Venus should be explored even though it has dangers.,0
"The Facial Action Coding System (FACS) brings students a new type of learning environment. Author Nick D'Alto wrote the article ""Making Mona Lisa Smile"" educating readers on the new facial expression innovation from Prof. Thomas Huang and Prof. NICU See. Dr. Huang and his colleague use this tool to find new ways for computers and humans to communicate. This new system brings a new type of learning, allowing the students to retain and understand information better.",0
"D'Alto is the writer, but Dr. Huang has emphasized that FACS would bring the students a new type of online learning, making them more interested in the lesson. Dr. Huang explains this innovation as he says, ""A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored,"" Dr. Huang predicts. ""Then it could modify the lesson, like a human instructor."" (Paragraph 6). This new change would make the lesson more beneficial to the student as it would make the student more interested in the lesson, further allowing them to retain information better later on.",0
"The lesson may be beneficial to the student academically, but is it causing mental health issues as it supports more screen time? FACS is all computer based, meaning less time in the classroom and more time in front of the computer. The student would be conducting this program on a school computer as D'Alto explains, ""Your home PC can't handle the complex algorithms"" (Paragraph 7) the program ends up promoting more screen time, something that students should get less of, instead of human interaction, which our society needs more of. In a way FACS program is not beneficial or valuable to the student mentally as it promotes something that our society needs less of.",0
"This technology could be also very beneficial to those who do not have the best teacher or education available to them. When FACS makes that facial emotion recognition it adjusts the lesson, allowing the students to understand the lesson better, as Dr. Huang explained. This would be beneficial to students who have a poor education environment as their teachers might not recognize these facial expressions, causing the student to not understand the lesson which later leads them to falling behind in class.",0
"This new technology has many pros and cons, but also brings students a new way of understanding. FACS could possibly bring grades up along with educational improvement. This program may support more screen time, causing students mental health issues, along with eyesight to deteriorate, but if this program is used wisely, none of those things should happen. This new technology should bring a new way of understanding, making FACS a valuable resource to students.  ",0
"Dear TEACHER_NAME,",0
"You have to make a decision on whether to make all the students perform community service let me tell you my point of view. I strongly encourage you to have all the students perform community service for various reasons. The first reason is that some places desperately need help from young willing students. Also, this will help better prepare students for work in the future. Finally, the most important reason is that this will teach students responsibility. Now, ponder my reasoning and read about all of my various ideas about this subject.",0
"First and foremost, community service is a great way for low income and rundown places to get help from young willing students. They are strong and able to help for long periods of time. Some places, like community shelters, desperately need help because they are financially instable, and they don't have enough money to hire help. This will give them more help, and they will get things done faster. Also, this will save them a lot of money because they wouldn't have to hire anyone new. The work would get done, but at a faster and more affordable rate, not to mention that they will be very grateful.",0
"To add to my reasoning, this experience will better help a multitude of students gain insight into what It's like to work. People spend more time working than anything else and this experience will help them prepare for that. They will know what it is like to commit to a job. They will have to work to either get enough volunteer hours or get a good grade. Furthermore, they will have to help the best they can and give one hundred percent of their efforts in order to do well and gain the respect of who they are volunteering for. This is vital for a good relationship and for an overall good grade. This will help them prepare for what It's like to work in the real world. They even may find what job they really want to do by volunteering or volunteer where they want to work.",0
"Finally, the most important reason is that this will teach the students' responsibility. Nowadays students are lazy and just watch television or play video games all the time. This will make them strive for something better with their life. It will teach them what it means to work hard and to be dedicated. In this generation, the work ethic is at a minimum, and we are just downright lazy. This might make kids want to get up and work if they find a job or volunteering center that really interests them. They will eventually want to get up and go do their community service without being asked or told. They may even make a bond with whom they are volunteering for, and they may make a friendship for life.",0
"In summation, volunteering is very beneficial for various reasons. First, volunteering helps places that are in need of workers and a helping hand. Also, this experience will help better prepare students when they get jobs in the future. Finally, volunteering will give the students' responsibility. These are very excellent points that I know you will carefully consider and ponder, because that is the right thing to do. This is really what volunteering is about, not the material things you do, but how you change while doing them.",0

"Dear Senator,",1
I am writing as a concerned citizen to discuss the ongoing debate regarding the retention of the Electoral College or shifting to a popular vote system for Presidential Elections. I am of the stronger belief that maintaining our current system of the Electoral College is beneficial for stable and balanced representation.,1
"The Electoral College, as established in the Constitution, provides a balance between the election of the President by Congress and a popular vote of qualified citizens. This mechanism focuses on the objective of enhancing the voice of each state, particularly smaller ones who otherwise may be undermined in a simple popular vote system.",1
"While the detractors claim it can be confusing for voters and lends a higher risk of “faithless” electors, occurrences of such events are rare, as trust is rarely betrayed within the established elector slates of each party. Moreover, historically, discrepancies between the popular vote and electoral vote are extremely infrequent, with only five instances since the founding of our country.",1
"There are several practical reasons for preserving the Electoral College. Firstly, it provides a certainty of outcome. The existence of a winner-take-all rule in nearly all states inherently reduces the likelihood of a dispute over popular vote. Secondly, it demands a nationwide appeal from a presidential candidate, acknowledging that no single region can elect a president, ensuring a balanced and fair representation.",1
"Critics argue that this system leads candidates to focus only on swing states during campaigns, minimizing the focus on more certain states. However, while swing states may receive more focus during campaigns, it can be argued that energizing voters in these crucial states leads to higher information dissemination and therefore a more thoughtfully informed electorate.",1
"Finally, the Electoral College helps overcome a shortfall in the representation of larger states due to the equal representation of votes in the Senate. For instance, a win in a populous state like Florida would give a nominee 29 electoral votes, while the same win margin in Wyoming would result in just 3 votes. ",1
"While critics suggest that the Electoral College is outdated and irrational, I believe we should perceive it as a measure to preserve our federative system and safety guard the interests of smaller states, ensuring that the candidate who becomes president truly represents all sections of our country. Therefore, I kindly urge your support in advocating for the maintenance of the Electoral College.",1
Thank you for your time and consideration.,1
"Sincerely,",1

"In the world, there are people who believe in aliens or supernatural beings, while some do not. The face on Mars is an example of an occurrence that causes people to believe in aliens or supernatural beings. Even though this is true, there are still many people who think the landform is a natural occurrence. There are ways to prove that this theory for the landform is true. Reasons such as the landform being compared to natural, earth landforms, and it has similar characteristics as earth landforms help prove this is true.",0
"The landform was compared to a butte or a mess. This means it is quite similar to earthly landforms and may have occurred due to something that happened on Mars. The face on Mars is compared one main earth landform that was mentioned. The landform is Middle Butte, which is located in the Snake River Plain of Idaho. It was a lava dome that took the form of an isolated mesa.",0
"The face on Mars had the same look and height as an Earth landform, a mesa. It is true that there is an unusual shape to the face on Mars, there are similar occurrences that happen on Earth. Though this happens on Earth, people don't say that these Earth landforms were made by aliens.",0
"This landform is just like other occurrences on separate planets that resemble Earth landforms. Even though the landform resembles a human face, it doesn't mean the landform is an alien's doing. Just like landforms on Earth, there are more ways than one to prove the reason or the starting place of a landform.  ",0
"Can an activity outside school be helpful for students? An outside school activity for students may sound boring or too much work for them or requires too much of their time and energy, but they don't know that doing an outside school activity can benefit them in many ways. Such as, it helps them release stress, refresh their mind, be more active, productive, have a better social life and can lead them out of their comfort zone. Students can create a new way to live their life. They can discover new things about themselves that they didn't know, and because of a sport, club or activity that they joined it can be a life changer for them.",0
"If more students did activities outside school, that helps them be more social, talk more with other people and meet new people, have new friends and just have a better social life than they did before. If they do a sport like soccer, basketball, volleyball or any type sport, they will have to talk. They will have to talk with their teammates, tell them what he/she is thinking about to make the game even better and have new strategies for the game. Just like this also in any other activity. This little things about having to talk to people they don't really know will take them out of their comfort zone. At the beginning they might not like it because it's something they probably have never done before, and it probably is weird at the beginning, but that's a good sign that they feel weird, because it means that little by little they are getting out of what they are used to doing, and that makes them learn a whole new world that they didn't know about.",0
"Doing any activity outside school also work makes' people more productive and active. It converts the that way by making them get up and move, to go somewhere for them to finish and accomplish that activity. Having a goal in their mind about to go and win that game, or finish sewing where they left of yesterday or last week, finish that one book they were brainstorming about what to write about for like a week and finish investigating what they say that day while he/she was in that cave. Things like that it what makes people be more active and productive. That way people be more active because they always have in their mind their goal to finish it, and it gives them a feeling of excitement and suspense about what will happen in the future or about what they are about to discover and will learn. Because they always have that goal in their mind, that one thing they want to finish and accomplish, it makes them be a better person. For teenagers is even better for them to feel that way. If they do, they will not want to stay home all day doing nothing just eat, sleep and repeat, they will not want to, because they will want to know more. If they get out of the home and do more activities outside the house, it makes them become more healthy, stronger mentally and physically, and it makes he or she has a whole new point of view on how to see life, by just staying home and go out and do new things. He or she will also influence its family and friends, just by doing that activity. And how he or she influences other people even without wanting to. Well, people will see the or them have changed, so they will want to try it or copy you, because they will also want to change for good.",0
"Like always everyone has a lot of stress as some point in their lives, and that can be harmful for humans. Also, for mental and physical health because what you have in your mind your body will reflect it. Stress is one of the most common problems people have in their lives, it's something that does not go away easily and if you don't know how to control it, you can harm yourself, other people around you and people you love. That's why doing outside school/work actives may help you and other people a lot to deal with their stress. Because it mostly refreshes you mind about any thought you have, worry or feeling that has been going around in your head for a couple of days. It refreshes your mind a lot, because the activity that you are doing will distract you from any personal or just problems that you have, because you will mostly need to concentrate on the activity you are doing. If you don't have or do anything that can help you with that and don't know how to control it, you can lead yourself to make bad things, and that can get you to have even more stress and problems. Outside activities are helpful for your life over all, try it one day, maybe you will find it fun.  ",0
"Dear, TEACHER_NAME",0
I understand that you expect a lot out of students at,0
"SCHOOL_NAME and want them to do they best, and just because you our principal and care a lot about us, you will do whatever it takes for us to achieve. But doing work all the time can be tiring. I think if you have a C or higher on your report card, you should be able to do sports. As long as your student are passing they should be able to have fun and play sports. Not only is sports fun, it helps us with exercising and staying in shape. If students play sports and work out, they will work they brain and other body parts. Playing sports means a lot to us hear at your school because we can come together and work as a team.",0
"Sport shows us new things like getting your anger out in a good way, feeling good about yourself, teamwork, etc. I really hope you will let people with a C average play sports because we try our BEST here, and as long as we are giving you 110%, you should let us play sports and enjoy our selves !",0

"Successful people are not afraid to try new things and take risks. They know that in order to achieve great things, they need to push themselves outside their comfort zone. This willingness to experiment and take risks is what sets them apart from others and allows them to reach their full potential.",1
"For example, consider the story of Bill Gates. He was a college dropout who started a software company in his garage. At the time, most people thought he was crazy for trying something so risky. But Gates was not afraid to take a chance. He knew that if he didn't try something new, he would never achieve his goals. And his gamble paid off. Gates is now one of the richest and most successful people in the world.",1
"Another example is Elon Musk. He is the founder of Tesla, SpaceX, and several other successful companies. He is a risk-taker who is always trying new things. For example, when other people were afraid to send people into space, Musk founded SpaceX to make space travel accessible to everyone. His willingness to take risks has led to many groundbreaking innovations.",1
"Successful people know that in order to achieve great things, they need to push themselves outside their comfort zone. They are not afraid to try new things and take risks. This willingness to experiment and take risks is what sets them apart from others and allows them to reach their full potential.",1
"There is no doubt that our society has become increasingly wasteful in recent years. We are producing more and more garbage, and much of it is plastic bags and other types of packaging. This is a major problem, because plastic bags and other types of packaging are not biodegradable, meaning that they do not break down and decompose naturally. As a result, they accumulate in our environment, posing a serious threat to both our ecology and our health.",1
"There are several reasons why this has happened. One is that we have become increasingly reliant on plastic bags and other types of packaging. They are cheap and convenient, and so we use them without thinking about the consequences. Another reason is that our waste disposal systems are not adequate. We have not developed the infrastructure necessary to recycle or properly dispose of all this waste, and so it ends up in our environment.",1
"Ultimately, we need to take responsibility for our own actions. We need to start using less plastic bags and other types of packaging, and we need to demand that our governments do more to develop the necessary waste disposal systems. Only then will we be able to protect our environment and our health.",1
"I think limiting car usage is a great idea for America. Studies show that in Bogotá, ""the people are generating a revolutionary change."" Says Enrique Rear, the major of Asunción, Paraguay. People are either walking to their destinations or riding their bicycles. Also, the less you use your car, means less air pollution everywhere, so the Earth is healthier.",0
Limiting car usage could also help people's physical and mental health. Walking could lower your stress levels and let you think about the nature that you see instead of thinking about what your mad at. I know this from experience because I get stressed very easily and walking anywhere helps me calm down. Another thing about limiting car usage is that the car wreck percentage would be lower than it is right now. There would also be fewer deaths in the world if they limited the usage of cars.,0
"Did you know that there are prominently 118 miles of bicycle paths only in Bogotá? Well there is and according to Mocks, the city's major, ""It's the most of any Latin American city."" Also, you could use the bicycle paths as walking paths for exercise or just to walk anywhere. People would be in more shape if they limited cars. But the only bad thing about using a car in Vauban, Germany is that you have to pay for the car and a spot to keep it while only being able to drive it on the main thoroughfare, where the tram to downtown Freiburg runs.",0
In conclusion I think it would be a great idea for America to go car-free.,0
" Dear Senator [Last Name],",1
"I hope this letter finds you well. I am writing to express my strong support for the continued use of the Electoral College as the current method for choosing the President of the United States. Furthermore, I believe that the Electoral College is a crucial component of our political system and provides several benefits that are difficult to replicate through a popular vote. Furthermore, I appreciate your consideration of my perspective on this important issue.",1
"First and foremost, I believe that the Electoral College provides a sense of national representation in the election process. Each state is allocated a certain number of electors based on its population, which means that larger states have a greater influence on the outcome of the election than smaller states. This means that candidates must pay attention to all regions of the country and not just focus on densely populated areas, as they would in a popular vote system. This ensures that the best candidate for the job is elected, regardless of where they come from.",1
"Additionally, the Electoral College provides a degree of certainty in the election process. While electoral votes can still be contested, it is much less likely than a popular vote contested by a losing candidate. This means that the country can move forward quickly after an election, without the long and drawn-out process of a recount or court challenge.",1
"Another benefit of the Electoral College is that it forces candidates to appeal to a broader range of voters. In a popular vote system, candidates may focus on smaller, more liberal or conservative regions, depending on which group they believe will vote for them. However, in the Electoral College, candidates must appeal to voters across the country, which ensures that they are addressing the needs of all Americans.",1
"Finally, the Electoral College helps to prevent the tyranny of the majority. While a popular vote system may seem like the most direct way to choose a president, it can also lead to the unintended consequences of suppressing the voices of minority groups. By giving each state a certain number of votes, the Electoral College ensures that the elected president represents the will of the people as a whole, rather than just the will of the majority.",1
"In conclusion, I strongly believe that the Electoral College is a vital component of our political system. It ensures that all voices are heard, that the best candidate for the job is elected, and that the country can move forward quickly after an election. I urge you to continue supporting the use of the Electoral College in future elections.",1
Thank you for your time and consideration.,1

"We should keep the Electoral College it's a good process, and it keeps us from having the problem of elections in which no candidates receive a majority of the votes cast. Like in 1968 with Nixon and in 1992 in Clinton were they only got 43 percent plurality of the popular votes but with the Electoral College which invariably produces a clear winner. The Electoral College method of selecting the president may turn off potential voters for a candidate who has no chance of carrying their state Democrats in Texas, an idea of this is like a Republican in California. The Electoral College needs a presidential candidate to have trans regional appeal like South, Northeast,etc. With the Electoral College is UN likelier than a dispute over the popular vote. It happened in 2000 because that the winning candidate's share of the Electoral College invariably exceeds his share of the popular vote. An example is in 2012, Obama received 61.7 percent of the electoral vote compared to only 51.3 percent of the popular votes cast for him and Romney.",0
"The Electoral College is widely regarded as an anachronism, a non Democratic method of selecting a president that ought to be overpowered by declaring the candidate who get the most popular votes the winner. The advocates of this position are right in debating that the Electoral College method is not democratic in a modern sense it is the electors who elect the president, not the people. When u vote you're not voting for the presidential u pick for're actually voting for a slate of electors. Both party each selects a slate of electors trusted to vote for the party's nominee, but that trust is rarely betrayed however it is entirely possible that the winner of the electoral vote will not win the national popular vote. The Electoral college is good to stay.",0
"The Electoral College helps with Certainty of outcome, Everyone's president, Swing states, Big States, Avoid run off elections. A tie in the nationwide electoral vote is possible because the total of numbers of votes are 538 is an even number, but it is highly unlikely. The new president will have no regard for their interests, that he really isn't their president. The most thoughtful voters should be the ones to decide the election. So other being equal, a large state gets more attention from presidential candidates in a campaign that a small state does. Voters in a presidential election are people who want to express a political preference rather than people who think that a single vote may decide an election.  ",0
"What do most people think can do things better, people or machines? I, like most people, believe things are done better by hand. Would someone want a lifesaving operation done by a living doctor that knows what is going on and where things are, or a robot that is programmed to do it and could malfunction. I believe that driverless cars pose a threat against people and cars should remain in human control at all times.",0
"Cars do not actually see the things that surround them. If the driver decides not to pay attention and one of the cars sensors were to malfunction then the lives of many people hang in balance. Road constructions and traffic jams could pose a threat as well. When these things happen do the cars just shut down or try and get through themselves. Either way major safety hazards will arise. Just like in paragraph 2, right now ""driverless"" cars cannot even get out of a driveway alone. Unless some major adjustments were to come soon, driverless cars remain a huge threat to safety.",0
"What if someone were to get hurt in a driverless car accident? The car malfunctions and the driver could not take control and gets hurt. Who willingly takes responsibility, the driver or the company? Like stated in paragraph 9, to figure this out the country would have to make more laws. All that will waste a large amount of time for both the companies that make driverless cars and congress who makes the laws. Driverless cars will give people trouble before they even hit the road.",0
"I believe that driverless cars pose a threat against people and cars should remain in human control at all times. No matter what driverless cars do not have the instances and emotions as humans. Cars cannot see what lies 500 feet in front of them, only humans can see that. Technology fails too much and letting cars drive for us poses to great of a threat at this time.",0
"The main advantages that people seem to find in the less use of cars is that the bad and harmful emissions given off are being reduced. The amount of emissions entering our air daily is beyond belief. In Germany, passenger cars are guilty of 12 percent of the emissions; while here in America we give off 57 percent. Germany has made the change to allow you to have a car if it is parked in a city garage not near the living quarters, or you can pay $40,000 to have your own ""large"" garage. All malls, stores and parks are just within a walking distance. With the decrease in the number of cars, the access of public transportation has risen. Paris has recently joined this trend. Days after the record amount of pollution in the air clean air was just a must for these people. The next day you were ordered to leave your cars in the garage, or you would be fined a fine of 22 euros(31 dollars).",0
"Within the lack of cars moving around the people, digestion was down 60 percent in as little as 5 days. 27 people wanted to avoid the fine, so they had their cars impounded. France blamed the Diesel fuel. Dismal makes up 67 percent of vehicles in France. The goal is to promote alternative transportation. The idea that transportation emissions need to go away has led to this,"" these people are generating a revolutionary change. This change is crossing our borders."" Imagine bright red and yellow slides, green and blue swings with tons of kids running and screaming together, or 24 kids all split up into teams for a fun, friendly neighborhood game of kickball. This is what could happen if more countries begin to do what Columbia did. Children would have more access to parks and sports centers. With the sidewalks cleaned up, new restaurants and shopping malls have been added in which makes TH city seem more inviting, clean and happy place to be.",0

I think and I think I speak for the whole school we at least should have a D average because if you really want to play in a sport or do an activity you should keep your grades up above an,0
"F that way you passing you class or classes, but you also know that it's not all fun and games you have to do your studies first in order to be in any type of activity and if you do good in school you can accomplish anything in life. I know parents say that its good to be in any type of sport, but you have to like It's because it keeps you out of trouble well its true I mean if you change this policy you might see this straight student go from a good student to always calling his/her patrol officer to see if he/her doesn't have any type of weapon's please TEACHER_NAME think about how this is going to affect the students and our community.",0
Title: Suburban Life Beyond Cars: A Green and Healthy Pathway ,1
"The contemporary world and its patterns of urbanization and mobility have evolved primarily around the use of cars. Cities and suburbs are populated with extensive parking areas and highways, designed to accommodate automobile use. However, there is a shift towards limiting car usage due to numerous socio-economic and environmental benefits as demonstrated by examples from Germany, France, Colombia, and the United States.",1
"In Vauban, an experimental suburb in Germany, the idea of “smart planning” takes center stage as residents give up on cars, leading to a more peaceful, tension-free community (Rosenthal, ""In German Suburb, Life Goes On Without Cars"" 1-4). This has become possible through a city layout with reduced space for cars and widespread public transportation systems. The focus is on making suburbs more compact and bring shops a walkaway, which not only improves accessibility but also significantly reduces greenhouse emissions from cars (Rosenthal, ""In German Suburb, Life Goes On Without Cars"" 5-7).",1
"In Paris, smog pollution led authorities to enforce a partial driving ban during a day, creating a significant reduction in congestion and demonstrating an approach to smog reduction (Duffer, “Paris bans driving due to smog” 10, 14). Similarly, in Colombia, the annual car-free day when only buses and taxis are allowed has played a vital role in promoting alternative transportation and reducing smog (Silky, ""Car-free day is spinning into a big hit in Bogotá"" 21, 23-24). ",1
"American cities too are witnessing change. There has been a decline in car purchasing and more people are driving less (Rosenthal, ""The End of Car Culture"" 29-30), largely due to changing social attitudes and improved public transportation. With this shift, the demand for cars is likely going to decrease further, while encouraging a long-term cultural shift of less car usage (Rosenthal, ""The End of Car Culture"" 34-35).",1
"Therefore, limiting car usage brings a multitude of benefits. One of the main advantages is the significant environmental impact. Car emissions are one of the major contributors to harmful greenhouse gases, causing global warming and air pollution (Rosenthal, ""In German Suburb, Life Goes On Without Cars"" 5). Reducing car usage benefits not only the environment but also public health, as demonstrated by the decreased smog levels in Paris and Bogotá. ",1
"Socio-economically, mobility shifts within communities also lead to changes in living habits that promote healthier, more active lifestyles, driving positive community bonds. Opportunities for businesses to thrive are also visible, with public transport facilities, carpooling apps and car-sharing programs becoming more appealing in a car-reduced society (Rosenthal, ""The End of Car Culture"" 37). ",1
"In sum, severely reducing car usage leads to healthier, more sustainable, and more cohesive cities and suburbs. Although these adjustments may seem challenging, the adoption of public transport services and smart-planning, supplemented by forward-looking regulations and policies can make the transition smooth and beneficial, nudging us towards a greener, healthier and more resilient future.",1
"Dear Senator,",1
I am writing to you today to express my support for abolishing the Electoral College and electing the president by popular vote. I believe that the Electoral College is an outdated system that no longer serves the needs of the American people.,1
"The Electoral College was created in the 18th century as a compromise between those who wanted the president to be elected by Congress and those who wanted the president to be elected by a popular vote of the people. At the time, the country was much smaller and less diverse than it is today, and there was no way to ensure that a popular vote would be fair and representative of the will of the people.",1
"However, the Electoral College is no longer necessary or appropriate. The country is now much larger and more diverse, and we have the technology to conduct a fair and accurate popular vote. In fact, most other democracies in the world elect their leaders by popular vote.",1
"There are many reasons why I believe the Electoral College should be abolished. First, it is undemocratic. In a popular vote, every vote would count equally. But in the Electoral College, a voter in a small state has more power than a voter in a large state. For example, a voter in Wyoming has 3.6 times more power than a voter in California.",1
"Second, the Electoral College can lead to presidents who do not win the popular vote. This has happened five times in American history, most recently in 2016. In that election, Hillary Clinton won the popular vote by nearly 3 million votes, but Donald Trump won the Electoral College and became president.",1
"Third, the Electoral College encourages candidates to focus on a few swing states. This is because a candidate can win the presidency with just 270 electoral votes, and it is much easier to win a majority of the electoral votes by winning a few swing states than by winning the popular vote nationwide.",1
"Fourth, the Electoral College is confusing and difficult to understand. Many Americans do not understand how it works, and even those who do understand it often find it unfair.",1
"In conclusion, I believe that the Electoral College is an outdated and undemocratic system that should be abolished. I urge you to support a constitutional amendment that would elect the president by popular vote.",1
Thank you for your time.,1

"A computer can not tell if your happy or if your sad, or if your confused or upset or anger. You can act like your happy and not really be happy people do it all the time they put on a mask. A computer dost know what you're feeling, no one does but you so it's kinda stupid to think that a computer of all things can tell you what your feeling. In the article it stats how the software works and how your muscles in the face move when you show emotions. You can move the muscles in your face it also talks about how when you smile you become happy so acting happy makes you happy. You can't just become happy by smiling used there's something that makes you happy so if you said and smiling makes it better than why are there so many sad and depressing people out there. If smiling makes you so happy why isn't the world just a wonderful place. If this software is so good why don't they use it on criminals to see they're tell the truth or to really show if they show remorse for what they did. This is why i don't think that using a computer to tell emotion is very reliable.",0
"While driverless cars present some benefits, on the whole their development should be approached cautiously. ",1
"According to the article, autonomous vehicles could reduce traffic accidents substantially since 90% of crashes are currently caused by human error. Without human involvement in operation, vehicles could communicate with each other to coordinate movement efficiently and prevent collisions. This safety aspect is an important consideration. ",1
"However, the technology also raises serious concerns that have not been fully addressed. Privacy is one issue, as driverless cars would rely on sensors and data collection to function, allowing personal information to be tracked. More significantly, turning over control of vehicles to computers may have unforeseen consequences. While programmers aim to account for every scenario, it is impossible to predict every situation that could arise on roads with other human drivers still in control of most vehicles. Autonomous systems may make mistakes that result in accidents or even fatalities through no intentional fault of their own. Until the technology is proven to match or exceed human abilities in all conditions, this risk cannot be ignored.",1
"Perhaps the wisest approach is to advance driverless cars gradually through rigorous testing before widespread adoption, especially since the legal responsibility in accidents would be complex to determine. Developers must ensure that these vehicles can respond appropriately to any situation, with appropriate safeguards against data privacy violations or technical failures. Only once autonomous driving is conclusively demonstrated to be as safe or safer than human ability in all typical driving contexts should significant integration into our transportation system be considered. While promising benefits exist, premature or careless deployment could have devastating outcomes that outweigh any advantages. Overall the technology demands further refinement before relying on it extensively.",1
"In conclusion, driverless cars show potential to reduce accidents but also introduce novel safety and ethical concerns. A cautious approach prioritizing thorough testing is prudent before large-scale implementation or dependence on autonomous vehicles. The complexity demands careful consideration of all factors to ensure public well-being as this transformative technology progresses.",1
"Even though driverless cars are coming in the near future and have a lot of positive and negative aspects in my opinion I support the development for driverless cars. To convey why Driverless cars are a good thing is because is can save a lot of time and fossil fuel and is a lot more convent. For instance when the author states that, ""The cars he foresees would use half the fuel of today's taxis and far more flexibility than a bus. This line states how driveless cars can change the world for better and are going to be more apart then riding the bus.",0
"Some more interesting facts about the smart cars that make me more support it is when the passage talks about the Driving and the Assisting. For instance author talks about how,""Traffic Jam Assistant."" ""The can handle driving functions at the speeds up to 25 mph, but special touch sensors make sure the driver keeps hold of the wheel."" I think this is a good thing because it makes driving more a lot more safe for the driver, but at the same time does not sacrifice the drivers control of the car, and it will alert you if you need to take control of the car, which I think is very important, so there won't be any accidents.",0
"To argue why would you need a driverless car if you can just drive yourself is a very important question. Driverless Cars can be helpful and can maybe even save your life if you come across some reckless driver on the road. For example when passage states how, Some manufactures hope to do that by bringing in-car entertainment and information systems that use heads-up displays. Such displays can be turned off instantly when the driver needs to take over-something not available to drivers trying to text with a cell phone."" This line describes how the driverless Cars have many safety features and can be automatic turned off just in case of emergencies, which makes it even more convenient and a lot safer for the driver.",0
"To summarize my argument on self driving cars is that I think it's going to be a huge advancement for humanity and will improve our lifestyles for the better. The features in the passage that describes these smart cars such as the heads-up display, which is entiretantment system and information system which, can be turned off automatically in case of emergencies. Also, the Antilock brake and driver assistance, which can save a lot of lives.",0
These safety features are going to make driverless cars a success. Driverless cars are going to be apart part for the future and will improve the way we drive and our action as well and save many lives.  ,0
"As a fellow citizen, I strongly believe that limiting car usage is essential for our community. The passages provided offer numerous reasons to support this idea.",1
"Firstly, using cars less often can improve our health significantly. According to the World Health Organization, physical inactivity is a leading cause of death and disability worldwide. Walking and cycling are excellent ways to stay active, and by limiting car usage, we can incorporate these activities into our daily routine. Moreover, the exercise we get from walking and cycling can help reduce the risk of chronic diseases, such as heart disease, diabetes, and obesity.",1
"Secondly, limiting car usage can help reduce air pollution. Cars emit harmful gases that contribute to climate change and damage our respiratory health. The European Cyclists' Federation states that cycling emits 5-10 times less CO2 than driving a car. By choosing to cycle or walk instead of driving, we can significantly decrease the amount of air pollution in our community.",1
"Thirdly, limiting car usage can benefit our economy. According to the European Commission, cycling and walking can reduce traffic congestion, which costs businesses and individuals time and money. In addition, investing in cycling infrastructure can create jobs and stimulate local economies. By promoting cycling and walking, we can boost our community's economy and create a more prosperous future.",1
"Lastly, limiting car usage can improve our quality of life. The passage from the European Commission also states that cycling and walking can improve our mental health and overall well-being. By spending less time in cars and more time outdoors, we can reduce stress levels, improve our mood, and enjoy the beauty of nature.",1
"In conclusion, limiting car usage is crucial for our health, environment, economy, and quality of life. By choosing to walk or cycle instead of driving, we can make a positive impact on our community and create a better future for ourselves and future generations. I urge all citizens to join me in this effort and embrace a healthier, more sustainable way of living.",1
"Education is a life-long process that helps us learn new things and develop new skills. I definitely agree that education is a life-long process. There are always new things to learn, and we can always improve our skills.",1
"One reason why I agree that education is a life-long process is that technology is always changing. We have to keep up with the latest technologies if we want to be successful in today's world. For example, if we want to work in a field that requires computer skills, we need to keep learning about new software and tools.",1
"Another reason why I agree that education is a life-long process is that the world is always changing. We need to stay up-to-date on current events and understand how the world works if we want to be successful. For example, if we want to work in a field like international relations, we need to be familiar with different cultures and understand the complex geopolitical landscape.",1
"Finally, I think that education is a life-long process because it helps us develop new skills. We can always become better at problem-solving, critical thinking, and communication. For example, if we want to become a better leader, we can take courses in leadership development.",1
"In conclusion, I believe that education is a life-long process that helps us learn new things, develop new skills, and stay up-to-date on current events. It's essential for success in today's world.",1
"Have you ever been torn between multiple things to say or do? I have, but I went to my family for the help I needed. Seeking multiple opinions to motivate you on choosing the best decision is a vital role in making good choices because, those opinions can help you somewhat predict the outcome of the situation present.",0
"Seeking multiple opinions to motivate you on choosing the best decision is a vital role in making good choices because, those opinions can help you somewhat predict the outcome of the situation present. In order to make the best decision, you must go to the people you trust the most: your family. Family is always there for you, even when life seems at it's lowest. Asking the younger members in your family for advice might not be the brightest choice to make, but going to your elders is the best possible choice to make while seeking advice. Looking up to your elder family members is the best thing you can do when seeking opinions because, they have the most knowledge about how to act socially, and you know that you can fully trust them with what you're telling them. An instance where your elders come in, is what to say and when. Almost all teenagers have been made fun of or been in some form of drama and, they don't know what to say back to the bullies. That's where your elders come in. Your elders already know what it's like to feel that way, so they understand greatly. They give you multiple opinions and options to choose from when confronting the bullies. Many teenagers, including me have successfully stood up to bullies after talking with elder family members.",0
"Let's face it, we've all had to face some terrifying situations and, we didn't know what to do. But we all have our families to guide us to make the right choices. Seeking multiple opinions to motivate you on choosing the best decision is a vital role in making good choices because, those opinions can help you somewhat predict the outcome of the situation present. Next time that you're being faced with a challenge, go to your family. They will support you no matter what.",0
"Success is not a one-size-fits-all concept. It varies from person to person, depending on the goals they set for themselves. Some may view success as achieving financial stability, while others may consider it as having a happy family life. Therefore, I fully agree that true success can be measured primarily in terms of the goals one sets for oneself. In this essay, I will provide several reasons and examples to support my stance.",1
"Firstly, setting goals for oneself is crucial for achieving success. Without setting goals, we tend to go through life aimlessly without any clear direction of where we are going. Setting goals, on the other hand, gives us a sense of purpose and direction in life. It also helps us to prioritize our time and resources towards achieving our desired outcome. For instance, a student who sets a goal to achieve a certain grade in a particular course will work hard towards attaining that goal by studying regularly, attending classes, and seeking help when necessary.",1
"Secondly, measuring success based on personal goals provides a sense of satisfaction and fulfillment. When we achieve the goals we set for ourselves, we feel a sense of accomplishment and pride. This feeling of self-fulfillment is essential for our overall well-being and sense of purpose in life. For example, a person who sets a goal to run a marathon and trains for months to achieve that goal will feel a great sense of accomplishment upon completing the race.",1
"Moreover, setting personal goals allows us to measure our progress and make necessary adjustments. By setting specific goals, we can measure our progress and determine if we are on the right track. If we are not making progress, we can adjust our strategies and change our approach to achieve our desired outcome. For instance, a person who sets a goal to lose weight can track their progress by regularly weighing themselves and measuring their waistline. If they are not making progress, they can adjust their diet and exercise routine to achieve their goal.",1
"On the other hand, if success were to be measured solely based on external factors such as wealth, status, or fame, it would be difficult to achieve true success. The reason is that these factors are often beyond our control, and we may not have the necessary resources or opportunities to attain them. However, by setting personal goals, we can focus on what we can control and work towards attaining them.",1
"In conclusion, true success can be measured primarily in terms of the goals one sets for oneself. Setting personal goals is crucial for achieving success, measuring progress, and making necessary adjustments. It also provides a sense of satisfaction and fulfillment when we achieve the goals we set for ourselves. Therefore, it is essential to set personal goals and work towards achieving them.",1
"I am in grade 8 and I would like to talk about the issue of gun control, which is a highly contentious topic in many countries. I am in favor of stricter gun control laws because I believe that this will help reduce the number of deaths caused by guns.",1
"One reason why I support stricter gun control laws is that it will make it harder for criminals to obtain guns. If there are more background checks and waiting periods for purchasing a gun, then criminals will have a harder time getting their hands on one. This will ultimately reduce the amount of gun-related crime in our society.",1
"Furthermore, stricter gun control laws will also make it harder for people with mental health issues to get guns. If we have more thorough background checks and screenings, then we can prevent mentally ill individuals from purchasing guns. This will help reduce the number of mass shootings that are often committed by mentally unstable individuals.",1
"Lastly, I believe that stricter gun control laws will also help reduce accidental shootings. If there are more regulations and requirements for gun owners to properly store their guns, then this will reduce the likelihood of accidental shootings occurring, especially around children.",1
"In conclusion, stricter gun control laws are necessary for our society. They will make it harder for criminals to obtain guns, help reduce gun-related crime and mass shootings, and also reduce the likelihood of accidental shootings occurring.",1
"Okay, here's my attempt at writing an essay as an average 8th grade student on the topic of implementing a four-day work week in schools:",1
"Hey, so like, have you heard about this thing where schools might start having a four-day work week? I know, it sounds kinda weird, but I think it could be pretty cool. I mean, think about it, we'd have more time to hang out with our friends, do stuff we like, and just chill. But, there are also some pretty big pros and cons to it, so we have to think about that too.",1
"First, let's talk about the good stuff. If schools had a four-day work week, we'd have more time to do stuff outside of school. Like, I love playing video games and watching YouTube videos, and with an extra day off, I could do that even more. Plus, my parents are always bugging me to help with chores and stuff, and with an extra day, I could get more stuff done without feeling so overwhelmed. And, let's be real, who doesn't love having an extra day to sleep in and relax? It's like, the best.",1
"But, there are also some pretty big cons to it. Like, teachers and other staff members might not be super happy about it. They might have to work longer hours on the days they are in school, which could be pretty tough. And, some people might be worried about how it could affect their grades and stuff. I mean, if we're not in school as much, might we not learn as much? That's a pretty big concern.",1
"And, there's also the thing about money. I know schools need money to run and stuff, and if they have a four-day work week, they might not have as much money to spend on things like supplies and stuff. That could be pretty bad.",1
"So, like, overall, I think a four-day work week in schools could be pretty cool, but we have to think about all the pros and cons and make sure it's going to be good for everyone. I mean, we don't want teachers and staff to be super stressed out or for students to not learn as much. It's like, a pretty big decision",1
"Dear Principle,",0
"I think that the principle is being unfair because students are actually trying there best on having good grades. I think he should give them one more chance because there trying best. If you don't do anything about them, we would were going to sign a petition and were going to get the whole students get it sigh even the teachers. If you still don't let them play a sport then were going to get our super attended on this and I know he would do something about it because he's nice. He's going to see that were trying our best on our grades.",0
So either you want to do it the nice way or you want to do it the bad way? It's your choice were just letting you know before we go and do it the bad way. It's not fair that you're taking our sports away from us that's the only good thing we have in school and friends so please I'm asking nicely don't take our sports away from us.,0
We promise were going to try our best on getting a better grade then before. We promise were going to stay to tutoring at least twice a week if we have to we don't really care because we don't want to lose our sport.,0
"Furthermore, we fight for what we want please give us another chance?",0

"Working in a group can be beneficial in an academic setting as it allows for increased collaboration, creativity, and new perspectives. By discussing tasks, researching topics, or completing tasks together, it can significantly increase the quality and efficiency of the work. For example, if working on a group project in an Introduction to Psychology class, different members can bring their unique viewpoints and perspectives, allowing the final project to be more comprehensive and creative than if one student had completed the project alone. ",1
"However, there can be drawbacks to working in a group. In addition to the potential challenge of coordinating schedules and meeting times, other issues can arise, such as potential discrepancies between the amount of work each person contributes and the weight of each member's contribution. This could lead to conflict and a less than ideal outcome. For example, if two people in a group are especially invested in a project, but the other two contribute little effort, the final result could be negatively impacted. ",1
"In conclusion, although working in an academic setting with a group can be beneficial in several ways, the potential issues within the group may outweigh any potential benefits in some cases.",1
I would like our election to be cast on popular vote. It would make more sense for us to be able to elect our president by what everyone thinks and not the electoral college because many things can go wrong. The votes in electoral college don't make sense big states have more votes than the little ones so the candidates focus on big states and the other ones are left out because they have two or three votes. That's why I think we need a different system or just cast it on popular vote.,0
Just like the 2000s election Bush won that by getting the bigger states when Gore should've won it because he had more popular votes. The electoral college makes no sense and should be taken down. Many people disagree with the electoral college and know it's a big scam for the presidents to win by losing. That's why it should be cast on popular so it's fair for people and not on the size of your state.,0
"The electoral college is an outdated, unfair system on voting. It shouldn't be about the state but what all the country thinks. Popular vote is the best way to calculate who should be president and who not to be. Our nation would be better off with a new system because the electoral college is getting outdated and isn't a good way to vote for who leads our country. We need a new system because in several places they have never seen a candidate or ad to vote in 2000 campaign. Those states didn't see anything because of their electoral votes are small compared to those of the bigger states.",0
"Also, you can tie the votes in electoral votes, and then we'd have to worry about the vote our House of Representatives would give us. That could be a disaster for us to worry about. Just like Nixon and Clinton had 43 percent of popular vote but winning in the electoral college. It's not fair for most people, and it doesn't make sense how he can win but still be losing at the same time. I wouldn't vote until this system is changed because it is completely unfair.",0
"The electoral college is an unfair system that no one wants anymore. We can change our ways of voting, so it'll be more fair, and it matters on our country's thoughts not our states. Popular vote seems more reasonable and a better way for us to find a good leader. That's why I think it should be cast on popular vote instead of the electoral college and the United States of America would be better off with what our whole country thinks instead of our size because we represent freedom and need to prove it.",0
"Dear TEACHER_NAME I agree with you're choice to not allow students to participate in sports and other activities because it will both encourage the students who are already working hard to keep doing so, and it will urge the students who are not doing well to try harder. I think that as a result of your choice more students will try harder in all of their classes, but I also see why you should not make that choice based on the effect it will have on the students. For the students who are doing well they might turn into bullies and start to pick on the students who are not doing so well. For the students who are not doing well it may depress them in two ways one way it could affect them is making them a target for bullies and that ties into the second effect sadness which can lead to the even greater plummet into them failing and then depression and lack of confidence. My stance is that you should change the policy.  ",0
"Being a good person and a good citizen are two important qualities that people should strive for in life. By researching these qualities, one can gain insight into how their own problems can affect their career, and how exhibiting good behaviors can help them in life. It is also important to be a good student in order to gain credit for college, as well as to be responsible and work hard to complete goals. Lastly, helping other people can make a huge impact, and demonstrates good behavior. It can be as simple as offering a lending hand to a neighbor, or donating to a local cause. All in all, developing and exhibiting qualities of a good person and citizen are essential for a thriving and successful life.",1
" It is true that many students desire to graduate early with all the necessary credits, but few are able to achieve this due to the high standards required. While some may prefer to take the full four years of high school to graduate, others would like to take the shorter route and still obtain all the necessary credits. However, achieving this goal is not an easy task, and it requires a significant amount of effort and dedication.",1
"In my opinion, it would be beneficial for students to have the option to graduate with three years of high school, provided that they are willing to put in the extra effort to complete the required courses. By doing so, they would be able to finish their high school education earlier and move on to college, work, and a career at a younger age. This would be particularly advantageous for students who do not enjoy spending too much time on schoolwork and would like to achieve their goals more quickly.",1
"I have seen firsthand the benefits of early graduation. Some of my friends have graduated early due to their excellent grades, which gave them enough credits to graduate. They are now in college, pursuing their dreams and achieving their goals. I believe that it would be a good idea to give other students the same opportunity if they choose to take it.",1
"In conclusion, while graduating early with all the necessary credits is a challenging task, it is definitely achievable with hard work and dedication. Providing students with the option to graduate with three years of high school would be a valuable addition to the educational system, as it would allow students to finish their high school education earlier and move on to the next stage of their lives.",1
"Mona Lisa's facial expressions were ""determined"" by the Facial Action Coding System. It determined that she was ""83 percent happy, 9 percent disgusted, 6 percent fearful, and 2 percent anger"" (D'Alto). This super high-tech machine can identify your emotions based on analyzing the muscles in your face. But is the technology really needed in classrooms?",0
"The knowledge of emotional expressions to teachers can be very beneficial. Everyone knows that kids don't learn the same and keep up at the same pace. Teachers could use this for kids to know how comfortable they are with the lesson. In the text it states, ""'A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored,' Dr. Huang predicts. 'Then it could modify the lesson like an effective human instructor'"" (D'Alto). This shows that FACS can help students who don't understand the lesson, by looking at their facial expressions, and changing the lesson to fit them.",0
"Others would argue that facial expressions for every person and emotion are different. As the author pointed out in the text, ""The facial expressions for each emotion are universal"" (D'Alto), people will disbelieve because not every person shows the same emotion the same way. Some opposers would argue that the addition of the system to education would drastically bring up the cost. Making schools more expensive and put schools at an advantage.",0
"Although I agree that not every face makes the same expression,",0
"FACS can identify the way the muscles move to indicate the emotion. In the text it states, ""This process begins when the computer constructs a 3-D computer model of the face; all 44 major muscles in the model must move like human muscles"" (D'Alto). This quote shows how the system works and to identify the muscle movement in your face. While, yes the cost of education will increase due to the addition of FACS, the benefits will outlay the costs. Like any technological addition to schools, they use funds and sponsors to help pay for that stuff. Helping kids find a new way to learn and helping them succeed, seems a lot more important than costs.",0
"In conclusion, the Facial Action Coding System will help teachers and students worldwide succeed. When teachers know how to fix their lessons based on how their students learn, it makes the job easier for them, and they get to see their students grow. Although the FACS was able to identify Mona Lisa's facial expressions, they can be used for so much more in the real world.  ",0
"Computer games are loved by children and Adults alike. The reason why they are so popular is mainly because they are a great way for children to learn new things and have fun. However, some people think that computer games have produced more negative effects than positive ones on children's physical, intellectual as well as psychological development. Consequently, they suggest that effective measures should be taken to prevent children from playing them.",1
"One of the most common problems that computer games can cause is that they can be very addictive. Children who are addicted to computer games often find it hard to break the habit. This can lead to them spending more and more time playing the game, which can cause them to lose touch with reality. It also can make them less motivated to learn or do other things.",1
"Another common problem is that computer games can be very dangerous. Children who play computer games often do not know what they are getting themselves into. They can become very injured or even killed. This can have a very negative effect on their development, both physically and mentally.",1
Most of the people who argue that computer games have negative effects on children's development are not actually children themselves. They are adults who have already had some experience with computer games. These people are usually people who are not interested in helping children grow up healthy and happy.,1
"One of the best ways to prevent children from playing computer games is to make sure that they are not really interested in them. This can be done by education. It is also important to make sure that the games that children play are not too dangerous. If they are, then they should be removed from the classroom.",1
"Finally, it is important to remember that computer games are not the only things that can be bad for children. Other things that can also have a negative effect on their development include television, books, and other forms of communication. Therefore, it is important that parents be aware of the dangers that computer games pose to their children.",1
Cell Phone Use While Driving,0
"Drivers should not be able to use cell phones in any capacity while operating a vehicle. Using any kind of possibly distracting technology while operating a vehicle can put the driver, and others, at serious risk. Many people do not fully understand the risks that come with using a cell phone while operating a vehicle. While distracted driving they could hit someone or something, possibly leaving the driver and that person or thing seriously injured, damaged, or dead. These are just a few reasons for why drivers should not be able to use a cell phone in any capacity while operating a vehicle.",0
"In 2015, the NSC estimated that cell phone use while driving, alone, accounted for 27% of all car crashes in the United States and 25% of all motor vehicle crash fatalities. Also in 2015, there were 3,477 people killed and an estimated additional 310,000 people injured in accidents involving distracted driving. In the U.S. nine people are killed each day from distracted driving. Car crashes are the number one killer of teens in the U.S. This distraction is responsible for more than 58% of teen crashes. These statistics rise every year. And with technological advances in cars, radios, phones, etc., there are many things that can easily distract any driver. Drivers should keep in mind that it is okay to leave a text unread for a couple of minutes in order to safely respond when the vehicle is stopped and off the road. Or pull over if it is important to respond quickly. There is rarely an emergency so severe and emergent that a person would need to put themselves and others at risk of serious injury or even death, because if something happens to that person, they can not help in an emergency situation anyway.",0
"In conclusion, using a cell phone while operating a vehicle is extremely dangerous and risky. Drivers are not only putting them self in harm's way when using a cell phone while driving, but they are also putting other's lives and safety on the line. Drivers should not be able to use a cell phone in any capacity while operating a vehicle.  ",0
"Students are usually on their phones and doing other mindless tasks during summer break, and they don't stimulate their brains. As a result, some schools assign summer projects to ensure that their students learn over the summer and are better prepared for the next school year. These schools debate on assigning teacher-designed projects, which have specific guidelines, or student-designed projects, which allow for more creative freedom. These summer projects should be student-designed because students would be able to personalize their projects, the projects would be more enjoyable, and the students would put in more effort into their products.",0
"With student-designed projects, students are able to express their own creative styles. For example, in an interior design class, the summer project could be to design the students' dream house. One student may excel in drawing, so they could draw their dream house. Another student may excel in graphic design, so they could create a three-dimensional model of their dream house on a computer. Lastly, another student may like Legos, so they could build their dream house out of Legos. On the other hand, teacher-designed projects would minimize the creative freedom because they would set specific guidelines on how they want their students to complete it. All in all, students can complete their projects using the unique skills they have with student-designed projects.",0
"Also, students would find the projects more fun if they are able to design it. Summer break is a time for students to have fun. When a teacher designs a project, there are usually set guidelines on how they want the project, which sometimes isn't what students would enjoy. This would make it difficult for students to find the motivation to complete their projects, especially over summer break. On the other hand, with student-designed projects, students would be able to personalize their projects, so they could use their own interests to complete it. When students are able to individualize their projects, they find it more enjoyable to complete since they would include aspects that they enjoy and minimize aspects of the project they could potentially dislike. For example, in the previously mentioned interior design summer project, the student who excels in drawing could dislike using computers. If the teacher had required the dream house to be made on the computer, the drawer could find it difficult to finish the project because they don't enjoy using computers. In contrast, if the drawer was able to design their own project, then they could draw their dream house while having fun.",0
"Lastly, in student-designed projects, students would put more effort into completing their projects. Generally, students put more effort into the subjects that they enjoy. Similarly, if students are able to design their own projects, they would enjoy completing the projects and work harder on them. If the previously mentioned interior design teacher required everyone to build their dream house out of Legos, the student who draws and the student who enjoys graphic design would enjoy the project less and find little motivation to complete it over the summer. As a result, the drawer and graphic designer would put minimal effort into their Lego dream house, for they may just build a house with little detail and minimal unique thinking. On the other hand, if the dream house project was a student-designed project, the students would put a lot of effort into creating their dream house since they are able to design it with the skills that they have and enjoy using.",0
"Some may argue that students could design the summer projects, so they require minimum effort since they want to complete their projects as quickly as possible. However, when you give students creative freedom, they are more likely to put in extra effort because they would enjoy their projects more. Schools that require summer projects should assign student-designed projects because students are able to use their unique skills and interests to complete these projects. Additionally, students would have more fun completing these projects since they are allowed to express their own creativeness, which helps motivate the students to complete it during summer break. Lastly, students are more likely to work harder on their projects because they would find their student-designed projects more enjoyable to complete.",0
"Dear Principal,",0
"I have heard that you are considering two new phone policies. Policy 1 is about letting us, the students, bring our phones to school and being able to use them at lunch and other free times. While Policy 2 is not letting us have our phones at all while at school. As a student myself I have to agree more with Policy 1. Letting us use our phones during lunch and other free times would let us communicate more with each other. During class most of what we think about is probably what we are going to say to our friends the next time we see them. Since we have no time to coordinate where to go for free time with our friends we might miss them. If we could use our phones to text them we could meet up. A friend that is sick and missing classes might want to catch up on work, so they don't get too far behind. The friend at school could call them at lunch or free time and tell them if anything important is going on. Along with telling them about school work, we wouldn't want them to get too bored, now, would we? Our friends are how we get through the day. They are what makes us look at the white board and say ""I can get this. I can learn."" When we are lost they're the ones who put us back on track and the ones who show us the way. If you allow us to use our phones outside the classroom they can do all of these things from across the school, and I'm sure that we would do much better inside the classroom. Phones are the way that we keep up our friendships with those that we never see. I have a friend that the only time I see her is if we happen to go to the same place for free time. Once in a while we will run into each other in the hall and say where to meet but only like once a month. All her classes are upstairs while mine are all downstairs and on the other side of the school. Can you guess the way we've stayed in contact? Yep, that's right, cell phones! To some it may sound stupid and cheesy, but cell phones are what keeps our lives together. Unless you would rather put all friends together in one classroom, I think the best way to go is Policy 1.",0

Luke Merger had no idea how his life would change after graduating high school. After graduating from high school Luke Bombers friend asked his if he wanted to go on a cattle boat. The reason they had the cattle boats was because World War II had just ended in Europe. After World War II ended many countries were crumbling. They needed the cattle boats for milk and meet to feed the people who had no home because of the war. I will list some reasons why he said yes.,0
"A reason Luke Merger joined the cattle boat knew it would be fun. Another reason Luke Merger joined the Europe on a cattle boat trip was because he said ""Luke couldn't say no. He knew it was an opportunity of a lifetime."" Luke went on his first trip in August 1945 when he had orders to go to New Orleans. Luke and the other crew members arrived on the 14th of August 1945. It took about 2 weeks to cross the Atlantic Ocean.",0
"While Luke was on a trip to Greece he had his 18th birthday, Luke could've gone to the military, but his draft board told him to stay. By the time Luke was discharged he had been on 9 cattle boat trips, that is the most of a sea going cowboy.",0
"Venus is one of the closest planets to Earth and is also referred to as our sister planet. We have sent many probes to Venus, yet many have not survived more than a few hours. Venus may be very close to us compared to other planets in our solar system, but it is far different in its characteristics. In the article ""The Challenge of Exploring Venus"", the author shows how Venus is dangerous but still worthy of studying by giving us evidence and examples about Venus and its features.",0
"The author gives us statistical evidence on how our planet is different from Venus. He explains that its temperature, atmosphere, and its acidic clouds are making the planet uninhabitable for humans. The author writes, ""A thick atmosphere of almost 97 percent carbon dioxide blankets Venus. Even more challenging are the clouds that are highly corrosive sulfuric acid in Venus's atmosphere. On the planet's surface temperatures average over 800 degrees Fahrenheit, and the atmospheric pressure is 90 times greater than what we experience on our own planet."" (3) The other spits out many facts that support his claim that exploring Venus is a very dangerous job. 800 degrees Fahrenheit is very hot and would not EB suitable by a human. In fact, all of these features would make it hard for a human to live on Venus. All these points can help prove that Venus is still worthy of studying even though there are many dangers because it should interest scientists and others to find out how these conditions came to be, what could survive in these harmful conditions, and even possibly how to make it possible for humans to live there.",0
"The author also uses examples to support his claim that Venus is inhospitable for humans. Humans have many needs in order to survive on a planet and Venus does not qualify for many. The author writes ""such an environment would crush even a submarine accustomed to diving to the the deepest parts of our oceans and would liquify many metals."" (3) In this quote the either is referring to the pressure of the planet inside the atmosphere. If a submarine could not survive the pressure, I doubt a human could either. The author also says ""Venus has the hottest surface temperature of any planet in out solar system"" and it has ""erupting volcanoes, powerful earthquakes, and frequent lightning strikes to probes seeking to land on its surface."" This is impressive because even probes that are specifically made for going to Venus, can't even survive on Venus. This proves that Venus is very dangerous but still worthy of studying because it challenges scientists to find new ways of making stronger probes and new ways to study this planet that prove effective.",0
"The author uses many pieces of statistical evidence and examples to prove his point that Venus is worthy of studying even considering the dangerous conditions. It is worthy because it has insanely harsh temperature, atmosphere, atmospheric pressure, and other harmful characteristics. Would you want to study Venus considering its deadly differences?",0
"Imagine being on a vacation in the Bahama's and realize that you have to finish two book reports by the end of the trip. Now your vacation is totally ruined! You now are going to have to postpone relaxing and having fun, because you have to do school work before classes even start. The majority of schools around the country include summer learning assignments; which purposes as a way to help students get ready for their upcoming classes. This could include a genre of ideas of work to be assigned that teachers could choose from. Most student's don't enjoy these projects; since, most kids don't want to start thinking about school until, the doors are open again. They would usually prepare you at a younger age with summer reading to help the gradual adjustment to essays, projects, and many more, easier to do. The issue is that, more and more students forget or never finish, these summer homework assignments, due to the lack of enjoyment or increased procrastination. So if you could choose your own project, would it be more likely that you would complete it?",0
"If students could create their own homework assignments, what would it look like? A student could choose topics such as, sports, television, friends, family, location, or anything else that they could think of. Maybe if teachers assigned essays over break, students could choose what to write about. For instance, maybe they would like to explain what they did during summer or, describe their favorite sport, food, TV show, and even create a bibliography about themselves. I know that many students still wouldn't enjoy writing or reading over their summer vacation; but, what if a student could choose to do anything they wanted, instead of writing. They could make a picture collage, poster, PowerPoint, painting, or whatever they'd want, to show how their vacation is going or why they like a particular topic. If your school let you pick what to work on during break, what would you choose?",0
"Why do students prefer not to do these assignments in the first place? What are teachers asking kids to do that's so uninteresting? Since you started enrolling in school, your teachers would choose to give you work during summer break. This was to help kids be more comfortable before starting the following school year. It usually starts with summer reading to help lead up to research projects or essays. If you're about to start entering AP classes, you're more likely to have more difficult assignments. If you're not taking an honor or AP class, it's less likely you're going to be given summer projects. Kids could tend do be less interested due to amount or difficulty they're given. What's the hardest assignment your teachers given you?",0
"The real question is, how could we persuade school districts to allow these types of learning assignments? My school's county has social media accounts such as,",0
"Instagram and Twitter, that will inform parents, faculty, staff, and students, important messages about our community. If your school has a social media account, try to contact them or research your suggestion, so you could to see if your idea could even be possible. Getting a message back from a school social media account, can be harder than finding the answers you were looking for online. You could always ask a teacher, guidance councilor, or anyone at your school, to help you with any of your issues, including learning suggestions. If I was in this position, I would tweet at my county's Twitter or direct message them, to try to get the answers I'm looking for.",0
"At last, it's 2020, and our goal on easier summer projects, hasn't gotten the attention it deserves. We have self-driving cars and miniature robots to plan, remind, and clean for ourselves; but, we can't make school work more comfortable for summer. If we want to show our country that there's an easier way to prepare ourselves for school, we need to create an impressive thought out plan. We can figure out our main idea and focusing points, to later show our school counties all over the country, how important this subject is. Students just want a more relaxing and entertaining way to learn over their summer vacation, so why aren't we doing it?  ",0
Dear Principal:,0
"Word on the street is that you're considering banning cell phones from school campus. Now, you know as well as I do that the students are NOT happy about this at all. But I'm sure that that alone is not enough to convince you to let our cell phones be. That's why I'm writing to you about a policy that will allow cell phones on school ground, with a few limits, that will satisfy everyone.",0
"First off, let me tell you why banning cell phones altogether is a bad idea. The students will be infuriated if that idea is put into motion, and will not only defy the rule, but a handful of students might actually do worse things, such as texting in class. You see, if you take away something from the students, they'll not only continue bringing that said something, they will, just to show that they don't care what the school administration does, do worse things. It's just the way students my age are, and I'm sure the younger grades are just the same way.",0
"Plus, a lot of us actually need cell phones; many students are part of after-school programs or clubs, and they need to call their parents to gain permission to stay. In fact, a lot of students know when and when not to use their phones, and go along with it. It's only a handful of kids that actually disobey the rule of using cellular devices during class. The rest of us know the rules and why it exists and respect that. The rest of us want to learn, and do learn.",0
"Now, I propose an alternative to the ""no phone"" policy you are considering: let us keep our phones, but don't let us use them in inappropriate times, like in class. Let us continue bringing cell phones to school on the condition that we don't use them unless needed. I'm sure that we will be mature about this and honor your decision if you choose this rule. I promise you that if there are students that can't be grateful for the merciful decision you made, those will be minimal and can be dealt easily with ninth hour or lunch detention.",0
"In conclusion, I thank you for your time in reading this letter, and I'm sure you'll choose the better option. Remember, it's only a handful of kids that actually disobey the rule.",0
"Thanks for reading,",0

"I think it is very valuable because it knows if you're happy or sad which helps in a lot of ways. Another interesting example would be ""a classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored.""and the technology is so good it can make computer animated faces more expressive according to the text and can too for surgery videos. And the computer may not detect your emotional communication but noted Dr. Huang said ""so computers need to understand that too.",0
"""The process begins when the computer constructs a 3-D computer model of the face"" and all 44 important muscles in the model must move like human muscles.""it also says that we may sometimes not really know what is wrong with our friends, and sometimes we can because of their facial expression. Or just behavior in general but sometimes they don't want to show that emotion or what is in them the computer can detect all of that.",0
"So I personally think it would be great because some people are usually shy and wouldn't really express there selves to the class as if they were with their friends. So all we would have to do is just by a single glimpse on the computer we can tell what is going on maybe something happened. And she doesn't really know what to do so she seeks help from a counselor, and she just checks what is going on with her and just by that maybe her whole life could change by checking the computer. Tech is advancing a lot and is helping the Socrata positively and yet negatively but hopefully one day it will all come down to nothing but motive stuff.  ",0

"I think to make the school system better that community service is a good idea to do because. The students learn more about staying out of trouble. Because when you are in trouble u see that u will steal have work to no matter what because staying is not a good thing, so they show you by making you do community service. And maybe that will show you how to stay out of trouble and some people in joy doing community service because it makes them feel better about. Helping other and just cleaning is always helpful to your community to show how you care, and you want things to look better to show that you have a great community, and you like keeping it clean, and you would like others in your community to do the same to show that you care. Then if the community is clean maybe new people will come and like what they see about your community and would like to move in. So yes to me community service is a good idea.",0
"The stability of a society is determined by various factors, including economic stability, political stability, social stability, and cultural stability. However, one of the critical factors that can affect the sustainability of a society is how it responds to the extremes of human behavior. In my opinion, I agree with the statement that the stability of a society depends on how it responds to the extremes of human behavior. In this essay, I will provide specific reasons and examples to support my answer.",1
"Firstly, the response of a society to extreme human behavior can determine how well it can maintain law and order. In any society, there will always be individuals who may exhibit deviant behavior that can threaten the peace and stability of that society. These behaviors include acts of violence, terrorism, theft, and other forms of criminal activities. The response of the society to these behaviors will determine whether they will continue or not. For example, if a society responds to these behaviors by increasing security measures, punishing offenders, and rehabilitating them, then it will be able to maintain law and order. However, if the society responds to these behaviors with indifference, then it may lead to an increase in such behaviors, which can destabilize the society.",1
"Secondly, the response of a society to extreme human behavior can affect the mental and emotional well-being of its citizens. When individuals engage in extreme behaviors, they not only harm themselves but also harm the people around them. This can lead to fear, anxiety, and trauma, which can affect the mental and emotional well-being of the society. The response of the society to these behaviors can either help individuals heal or make them feel more traumatized. For example, if a society responds to an act of terrorism by offering counseling services to the victims and their families, it can help them heal from the trauma. However, if the society responds with hostility and aggression, it can make the situation worse, leading to more trauma.",1
"Thirdly, the response of a society to extreme human behavior can affect its reputation and image. In today's globalized world, the reputation of a society plays a significant role in attracting tourists, investors, and other forms of economic activities. If a society is known for its tolerance and ability to respond appropriately to extreme behaviors, it will attract more people and investments. However, if a society is known for its intolerance and inability to respond appropriately to extreme behaviors, it will drive away people and investments. For example, after the 9/11 attacks in the USA, the response of the society was to increase security measures, punish the offenders, and offer support to the victims and their families. This response helped to restore the reputation of the USA as a tolerant and resilient society.",1
"In conclusion, the stability of a society depends on how it responds to the extremes of human behavior. The response of a society can affect its ability to maintain law and order, the mental and emotional well-being of its citizens, and it's reputation and image. Therefore, it is essential for societies to respond appropriately to extreme behaviors to ensure their sustainability. The appropriate response should be one that promotes healing, tolerance, and resilience rather than hostility and aggression.",1
"The use of E-dictionaries has become increasingly popular among students today, leading to discussions about its merits and demerits in aiding English learning. Although E-dictionaries provide a convenient and quick way to look up words and check the spelling, I agree with the opinion that it's overuse may have more drawbacks than benefits for English learning.",1
"For one thing, relying too much on E-dictionaries may undermine the motivation to learn English vocabulary. Many E-dictionaries provide the function of translating words and phrases into different languages, which may make it less necessary for students to learn the English words and phrases. This can result in the diminishing of their enthusiasm and motivation in learning English. Moreover, since the translation provided by some E-dictionaries is not always accurate, using them as the only reference may lead to misunderstandings and lead to confusion in the learning process.",1
"Furthermore, overreliance on E-dictionaries may diminish our spelling ability. While it is true that E-dictionaries provide an effective way to check the spelling of words, constant use of the function can lead to over-dependence on it, making students lose confidence in their ability to spell correctly. This, in turn, may cause them to become reluctant in attempting to learn English independently and take more risks in their exploration of the language.",1
"In conclusion, I agree with the opinion that the overuse of E-dictionaries may have more drawbacks than advantages for English learning. Therefore, I believe that English teachers should encourage students to find a balance between the use of E-dictionaries and independent learning and exploration of English.",1
"Dear State senator, A lot of chatter about weather the president should be elected by electoral college or by popular vote is going around my school for the past couple of weeks, and I can't help but to give my own opinion about this argument. I believe that the popular vote should decide who is the president.",0
"I believe this because of two reasons. One, the citizens are the ones that are going to have to deal with this good or bad president for four years and possibly eight years. Also, the state senators can be bribed by one or the other candidates running for president. This candidate could have the worst plans for the next four years and all because he cheated to win. This could cause riots and prawns around the United States.",0
"Two, Electoral College is unfair to voters because of the winnertakeall system. What this means is that candidates are not going to focus on the States that they know they won't get any votes from. For example in source TW, during the campaign of 2000, seventeen states were not visited by either candidates, so they didn't get to see any campaign ads. This is unfair because it makes it harder, almost impossible for these states to choose on who to vote for because they had no presentations to choose from. This puts too much power in the candidates hands.",0
"Some may believe otherwise. For example, since the Electoral votes are from very experienced people that have put there life and time into knowing about what is right and wrong. They are much more experience than the normal citizens. Also, Electoral College prevents runoff elections to occur. For example in source three, the electoral College avoids the problem of elections in which no candidate receives a majority of the votes cast. This causes lots of pressure which would greatly complicate the presidential election process. With Electoral Collage, this produces a clear winner.",0
"In my own opinion the one that decided the winner is popular votes. There can still be Elector Collage votes, but the Electoral votes have too much power and is unfair to the citizens of the United States.",0
"The idea of an entire area having no car owners sounds a little strange to someone living in a big city. Especially a suburban area with no cars, but in places like Vauban, Bogota and even Paris have revolutionized the idea of transportation.",0
"Vauban, Germany-is a suburban area where 70 percent of the families that live there do not own a car, and 57 percent sold a car to move there. Car ownership is allowed, but there are only a couple places to park such as large parking garages at the edge of the development where you can buy a parking space for 40,000, and with the purchase of a home. Residents of Vauban such as Hadron Walter, mother of two children says when she owned a car she was always tense and that she is much happier without a car. Vauban is home to 5,500 residents and may be the most advanced experiment in low-car suburban life.",0
"Paris, France nearly hit the record for highest polluted city in the world, until they banned the citizens from driving to clear the air of the global city. People who had an even-numbered license plate were ordered to leave their cars at home or pay a 22-euro fine, which is $31 in America, the same applied to the odd-numbered plates the following day. Approximately 4,000 drivers were fined. Congestion was down 60 percent in Paris. After 5 days of intensifying smog rivaled Beijing, China, known as one of the most polluted cities in the world. Diesel fuel was blamed for the mass pollution, Diesels make up 67 percent of vehicles in France. The smog cleared enough for the ruling French party to rescind the ban or odd-numbered plates.",0
"In Bogotá, Colombia there is a program that is set to spread to other countries, where millions of Colombians hiked, biked, skated, or took buses to work for a car-free day, leaving the large capital city devoid of traffic jams. The goal of this car-free day is to promote alternative transportation and reduce smog, the turnout was successful. Citizens of Bogotá like Carlos Arturo Plaza says it's a good opportunity to take away stress and lower air pollution. For the first time two other Colombian cities, Cali and Valledupar, joined the event. Higher authorities from other countries came to Bogotá to see the event. ""These people are generating a revolutionary change, and this is crossing borders"" said Enrique Rear, the mayor of Asunción, Paraguay. Car-free day started in the mid-1990's and as created the construction of 118 miles of bicycle paths, the most of any Latin American city.",0
"Getting out of your car and taking a walk for a couple miles is something you should consider doing every day. Walking has an insane amount of advantages, it can even save your life. The amount of pollution in the world is doing nothing but rising and the best way to avoid it getting any worse is reducing the amount of driving we do every day.",0
"There is no definitive answer to this question as it depends on individual experiences and preferences. However, in general, young people are more likely to enjoy life than older people are.",1
"There are several reasons for this. Firstly, young people are typically more optimistic and enthusiastic about life than older people are. They are more likely to see the positive aspects of life and to be excited about the future. Secondly, young people are typically more active and energetic than older people are. They are more likely to enjoy physical activities and to be social. Thirdly, young people are typically more open-minded and tolerant than older people are. They are more likely to be interested in different cultures and to be accepting of different people.",1
"All of these factors contribute to the fact that young people generally enjoy life more than older people do. Of course, there are exceptions to this rule, and some older people are very active and enthusiastic about life. However, in general, young people are more likely to find joy in life than older people are.",1
"Character traits are essential tools in determining who we are and how we interact with the world around us. Whether we are consciously choosing our characteristics or they have been molded by our environment, our traits have the potential to profoundly shape our lives.",1
"When individuals take on the task of examining their traits and actively choosing which ones to foster or abandon, they are engaging in the practice of self-development. Being aware and mindful of the qualities that define us and the consequences they may have, allows us to take control of our lives and create our own destiny. These actions can lead to greater autonomy, happiness, and satisfaction with our decisions, as we are empowering ourselves instead of allowing ourselves to be a product of external forces.",1
"On the other hand, when character traits are acquired due to outside circumstances, we are left in a vulnerable state, as we are not in control of the messages conveyed by our traits. Depending on our upbringing, peer group, or societal norms, the traits that form us can be limiting and inhibit us from reaching our desired goals. If we do not question and challenge what has been instilled in us, we may become victim to our own preconceived beliefs and succumb to our environment’s restrictions.",1
"Therefore, it is important for us to become mindful of our character traits, as they play an integral role in determining the direction of our lives. Self-development and intentional self-growth can grant us the freedom to pursue our passions and find fulfillment in our lives.",1
"Dear, TEACHER_NAME",0
I think that policy number two is a great policy.,0
I think this because if students are allowed to have phones it would be a distraction.,0
"First this a good policy because without phones in school it would let students concentrate. Also, because students would be able to do there work without using their phone. This policy would let the students get good grades on their test. Students have the rest of the day after school to use there phone and text. This policy is also great because without having phones it would make this school a better one because it would show that the teachers want the students to do good and have a great future. There are many more great reasons why students should not be allowed to have phones during school. In conclusion that is some reasons why students should not be allowed to have phones during school hours.",0
"Dear Principle,",0
I have come to notice that our school might be going to do community service projects. I applaud you in the fact you are showing the littler kids that working for your community is a good thing. But it has also come to my attention that are a few students that would rather not do community service because it takes away from there time to do what they like to do. TEACHER_NAME I have found a way that can fix this problem. I propose that we set a day that students can do community service in school.,0
"For example on every third and fourth Wednesday we could set out forty minutes of class time for community service, like tutoring kids. Kids tutoring other kids is a great community service because it helps the student get better grades and will help the school for Fact. Another project we can do is a fun day with the students at the local special needs school. We can have a day were about twenty kids are selected by there grade average to go to the school and have a fun day, with a movie and popcorn, and just a day we could hang out together. TEACHER_NAME as you see these are only some community projects we can do, that is also reason to do this in our school because there are so many options the school could use for community service.",0
"Another reason we should have community service is because it can change people. I believe that sometimes doing one good thing, for someone else, can change someone. So if we have community service some unruly kids could go to a soup kitchen and see that they don't have it that bad and there is no reason to act this way without a pretty good reason or bring them to a detention center and allow them to talk to the kids, and give a small tutoring lesson since they are out of school for a while, and maybe seeing these kids will allow them to see what there doing and change.",0
"The last most important reason I think we should have community service is that in the future the student will have to have it to graduate, so you would be setting them on the path to success.",0
Thank you and I hope you take this into consideration.,0
Thank You again.,0

"Dear Principal,",0
"I think that making students have at least a b average in their classes is wrong. My reasoning for this statement is that most student have trouble getting at least a c average let alone a b average. If you were going to do this there would be a lot less people participating in extracurricular activities therefore less money for your school. Most of the kids participating in your extracurricular activities are jocks not geniuses. There would be a lot of people protesting this issue because without sports and other extracurricular activities a lot of the kids would have not made the friends they have today. These activities are not only about the competition it's about having fun. The schools are trying to promote a healthier lifestyle but without sports the kids would be less active and therefore there would be an increase in the obesity rates. Sports should be a healthy way to be more active not a way to make students spend hours a night studding. If u were to do this you might as well have no extracurricular activities at all because they wouldn't be enough students participating in them. I think the policy should stay the same not make it harder to have a social life. I personally hate the idea of this because school would be less fun without these activities to participate in. Most kids don't like school to begin with so this policy would just make it worse and make more high school drop-outs. These activities are the only way some people are going to get to go to college. In today's tough economy less and fewer students can afford college, so they need the athletic scholarships. You don't want to ruin the students' education, do you? Exactly you're trying to help them not put them down. The educational directors are supposed to promote it not make them not want to even attempt to go to college. Therefore, the policy should stay the same because of all the reasons stated in this letter and on behalf of the students, so thank you for taking the time out of your busy day to read this letter.  ",0
"School days can be a drag at times, and can cause a lack of interest and become unmotivated in school. Then at the end of every school day, most of us go home to relax from the day we went through, but sometimes going home to the same old routine can become boring. However, the principal announcing that every student should take an extracurricular activity sounds like a great solution to this, because these activities will allow students to interact with others, introduce students to be able to learn new skill sets, and give students a chance to participate in activities they love.",0
"One reason that the principal's decision is a good idea is because this will allow students to interact with each other more often. Sure, we do that every day during school, but if you were to join a club or group, it would be a great opportunity to make new friends. Since you would be choosing a group based on your interests instead of attending a common subject, this would mean that others in your group would share the same interests as you, which is great for connecting with others. For example, when I was in a little soccer league, I was able to talk and play with others while knowing that they liked the same things that I did, which made me feel included and a part of the team. Being able to interact with others also allow for the improvement of social and teamwork skills. Playing in a sport is a good example of this because of how teammates cooperate with each other to reach their goal and win the game. It can be fun during games when you pass the ball to each other before shooting a goal, making the whole team know that they all made a big contribution during the game.",0
"Another reason that having a required extracurricular is a good idea is how they can give students a chance to find new hobbies and skills. Whatever extracurricular you choose can introduce you to a skill set based off your liking. Say if someone were interested technology, computers, robots and such. They could join a coding or engineering club, which could become a new hobby for themselves. This can also apply to choosing activities out of someone's comfort zone. Students that choose to join groups out of their average liking can lead to the development of a new hobby that they never knew they had. Once when I had to stay after school to attend a concert, so I had to take an activity in the meantime. One of the few choices available was a social study group, which I needed at the time. It turned out to be a pleasant experience while working with others. Gaining new hobbies from extracurricular activities can also skills to help students find what they're going to do in the future. Like if someone were interested in wildlife or animals. That person could join a wildlife conservation group or an awareness group of some sort, so they could be involved with the thing they love and be introduced to a new skill that can also be beneficial in their community and even in their future.",0
"A third reason for why required extracurricular activities are a good idea is that they can allow students to enjoy themselves. Students know how it feels to have to lag through every school day, as well as having to worry about their grades and piling school work. Being in an extracurricular can take your mind off of school in the moments you're in that group, and let you enjoy the time you spend there instead of having to stress yourself out more than you can handle. And, as previously stated, you'll be able to spend time with other students who know what it's like to face unmotivated times in school, home, or any other place. They can all talk to each other and do what interests them while even learning about topics without having piles of work to do afterwards, like in a coding club. And you'll be able to relax more often, or at the very least do what you think is fun. Like make arts and crafts, make or play games, play a sport, help the environment. Whatever you enjoy doing, there's most likely a club just for that. Something that you and any other student can enjoy.",0
"Having to take a required extracurricular activity doesn't seem as bad when you think about it. You're able to be with and connect with others, discover new activities that you didn't even know you would enjoy, and take your mind off of the stressful events going on and enjoy yourself. So if you like the sound of that, then having an extracurricular seems like a great idea that you can give a chance.",0

"I think that the students should be allowed to use there cell phones during free time. It is not like they are going to cheat on a test because they are at lunch. But I also think that they really don't need them unless they have to text their parents. They really don't need them because they are at school with all of their friends so who do they need to text because all there friends are with them. Before the students go into class they should have to drop their phones into a bin, so they do not get tempted to text during class. When they have free time they should be able to use them because after all it is free time. They should also be able to use them at lunch because they might need to text there parents or a friend to tell them what time to pick them up or to bring them lunch because they forgot theirs. The second rule about not letting students have a cell phone at school at all is a bad idea to me. They should be able to use there phone because they might need them, and they are the same as going on a computer at lunch because you can still email people and go on the internet. So why should you not be able to use cell phones if you can use computers. I think that you should pass the first policy instead of the second because all the students would enjoy being able to use them at lunch.",0
"University education has been a topic of debate for many years, with some people believing that the primary purpose of a university education is to prepare students for employment, while others believe that it has other functions. In my opinion, while preparing students for employment is one of the primary functions of university education, it is not the only function.",1
"To begin with, university education helps students develop critical thinking, problem-solving, and analytical skills. These skills are not only essential for success in the workplace but also in everyday life. For example, university students are required to analyze and evaluate complex information from various sources and make informed decisions. These skills are not only beneficial in the workplace but also in personal and social situations.",1
"Moreover, university education provides students with the opportunity to explore their interests and passions. Students can choose from a wide range of courses and majors, allowing them to pursue their interests and discover new ones. This exploration of interests and passions can lead to personal growth and self-discovery, which is equally important to employment.",1
"Furthermore, university education provides students with the opportunity to engage in research and community service. These activities not only benefit society but also help students develop skills such as teamwork, communication, and leadership. These skills are highly valued in the workplace and can increase a student's employability.",1
"However, it is undeniable that preparing students for employment is also an important function of university education. Universities provide students with the knowledge and skills required for their chosen profession. Many universities also offer career services, internships, and job placement assistance to help students transition into the workforce.",1
"In conclusion, while preparing students for employment is an important function of university education, it is not the only function. University education provides students with critical thinking, problem-solving, and analytical skills, the opportunity to explore their interests and passions, and the chance to engage in research and community service. These functions are equally important to a student's personal and professional growth.",1
Driving into the Future,0
"What if when you drove your vehicle there was a computer driving next to you and driving you? Google and GE have made self-driving cars that survey the surrounding area to have all the peripheral vision as a human and drive for the human. Google estimates the vehicles would use half the fuel used today and that these cars would fundamentally change the world. Self-driving cars use computers that process situations and scenarios just as well if not better than humans, still allow some control through construction or traffic, and eliminate the despised people that text, do make up, or eat while driving.",0
"Most people would agree that computers are smarter than people and can process situations and scenarios faster than people too. For instance, I know of no one that can do math faster than a scientific calculator. So why not have a computer drive for us. In the end it would result in safer transit and maybe even earlier arrival time. Smart cars, as the leading industries call them, use a spinning sensor on the roof of the car to form a constantly updating 3-D model of the car's surroundings. Humans can only see so much through their two eyes while maintain eyes on the road. These cars are maintain a constant image of their surroundings, not just what is in front of them. This leads to safer travel and ultimately smart cars driving better than humans.",0
"While the computers do have a complete 360 degree view around them, they still require human interaction. BMW announced the development of ""Traffic Jam Assistant,"" a car than can handle speeds up to 25 mph by itself. This smart car has special touch sensors that make sure the driver keeps hold of the wheel to ensure that in case of an emergency the driver can safely navigate out of it and override the computer's autopilot. These smart cars allow you to steer, accelerate, and brake, but are designed to notify the driver when the road ahead requires human skills, such as driving through work zones and around accidents. This means the human driver must stay alert and ready to take control at a moments notice in case of an emergency, so humans are not completely out of control.",0
"With all the technology and distractions at the wheel a world where the technology drove the car might not be such a bad idea. For example, there have been multiple accidents a year due to texting while driving. In many states you can get pulled over by the police for doing things such as texting at the wheel. But what if smart cars made the world safer from texting and driving, or make up at the wheel, or even the people that eat meals or take drinks while in transit. With smart cars' people that do those things will have trouble doing them if they have to keep hands on the wheel, but if they still manage to get a text or bite of food, the smart cars will be in control and there to steer them to safety. This would keep not only the people who text and drive, eat, or do make up safer but the people around them would also be away from that danger that they themselves can not control.",0
"Smart cars might not be the first thing many people jump at as the way to go. But smart cars might be one of the safe options to eliminate human error and reduce accidents, driving casualties, and risks. Smart cars are just as equal if not smarter than humans, they are not in full control in case of emergencies, and they can save a life if there is a driver texting, eating, or doing make up at the wheel. I would certainly choose the computer driving me, my friends and coworkers around for my safety and theirs.",0
 Four-Day School: A Debate between Benefits and Disadvantages,1
"The debate surrounding the adoption of a four-day school week has been gaining traction in recent years, with many businesses and educational institutions considering the option. While there are certainly advantages to having a shorter school week, there are also potential drawbacks that must be carefully considered before making a decision. In this essay, we will examine the benefits and disadvantages of a four-day school week and explore possible solutions to mitigate any negative consequences.",1
"One of the main benefits of a four-day school week is the potential for increased productivity and focus during class time. By reducing the number of school days, students would have more time to devote to their studies and complete assignments more efficiently. Additionally, having an extra day off each week could provide students with the opportunity to catch up on any missed work or seek additional help from teachers or tutors.",1
"Another potential advantage of a four-day school week is the opportunity for students to engage in extracurricular activities or pursue hobbies outside of school. With an extra day off each week, students could have more time to pursue their interests and develop new skills. This could lead to increased creativity, motivation, and overall well-being.",1
"However, there are also potential drawbacks to a four-day school week that must be considered. One potential disadvantage is the potential for reduced attendance and academic performance. If students are not attending school on the fifth day, they may be missing out on important information or falling behind on their coursework. Additionally, teachers may struggle to keep up with the increased workload of teaching for fewer days each week.",1
"Another potential disadvantage of a four-day school week is the potential for increased stress and burnout for both students and teachers. With fewer days off each week, students and teachers may feel more pressure to complete their work and may struggle to find time for rest and relaxation. This could lead to increased stress levels and decreased overall well-being.",1
"To mitigate these potential drawbacks, there are several possible solutions that could be implemented. One option is to extend the school day by two hours each day, which would provide students with more time to complete their work and engage in extracurricular activities. Additionally, schools could offer additional resources or support for students who may be struggling to keep up with their coursework, such",1
"""No one cares about the environment."" said no one ever. The environment we live in, whether it's a crowded city like New York, or Paris, or even a regular suburban community, is a wonderful place. There is one issue though that has spread among communities, and that is the high amount of car usage. Having a car and being able to track to great distances in a short amount of time is great, but look at what cars do to the environment. Also, when it comes to buying a car, you're basically throwing your bank account out the window. And don't get me started with the worries of having your children play in the streets.",0
"Now, let's discuss the crazy amount of money you have to throw away on a car. You either throw away a fortune on a good car, that runs good, and then end up taking years to pay it off, or you buy a cheap, beat up car, that is always in need of repair. Either way it is a loose, lose situation. Why buy these insanely priced cars when you can buy a nice bike that moves perfectly. At around five hundred dollars, to a thousand dollars a bike is easily the way to go. A bonus to buying a nice bike instead of a car, is that while you ride your bike, you'll get into shape in no time at all. Now if you need to track a great distance that riding a bike can not get you to fast enough, buses or mobile transport have bike racks on them, so you can ride a bus to the nearest position to where you need to be then simply ride your bike for the remainder of the distance.",0
"The main issue here with cars for most people, is that there is a large amount of pollution that comes with driving a car. In Paris the pollution from cars were so bad that Paris had to put a temporary ban on driving to help clear out all the smog that was in the sky. Also, in America car pollution is the second-largest source of pollution emissions. There is no other way to say it, cars make up a lot of the earths' pollution, and when the time comes that people start to die down on using cars the world will be a much healthier place to be in.",0
"Now you can not tell me that there is not at least one parent who will read this next statement and not agree more. Fewer cars, safer streets. Every mom, dad, brother, sister, or any kind of other relative have worried about their family playing in the streets. There are millions of accidents every year in the world that result in people getting hit by cars and killed, or seriously injured. With fewer cars on the streets the world will be a much safer place for kids, and even adults, as there is drunk drivers you have to look out for, or reckless drivers who don't even have a license.",0
"All together limiting car usage will have multiple benefits to the world, and even your own community. One being you don't have to pay for a car when they start going out of style, another being the worlds' pollution will lower at a huge rate, and last that the roads we live, and breathe on will be a much safer place. Limit your car usage and make the word a better place on step at a time.  ",0
"Some of the advantages we get from limiting the uses of cars are, we make cities denser, and safer and better to walk. Without cars people could walk the streets and not have to worry about someone running into them, or they wouldn't have to pay attention to their kids as much as we do today. If we didn't use cars today, we would have less drinking and driving accidents cause if u didn't have a vehicle u wouldn't be able to drive drunk. In the passage hadron Walter said they were happier without a vehicle when they had a vehicle they were always tense 70 percent of Vauban families do not own cars and 57 percent sold there vehicles, so they could move.",0
"Cars today have mufflers that blow out smoke to pollute the air Paris enforced a partial driving ban to clear the air of the global city. If u drove any vehicle in Paris the officers would stop u and u would get a fine for 31 dollars. Almost 4,000 drivers were fined. 27 people had there vehicles impounded just because of there reaction the fine that they were given. Congestion was down to 60 percent in France they had to suffer 5 days of smog china and Beijing was the number one polluted cities in the world. Deisel was the blame for 67 percent of pollution in France.",0
Paris has more smog than other cities Paris had 147 micrograms of particulate matter per cubic meter compared to 114 in Brussels and 79 in London. On the third straight year that cars have been banned with only buses and taxis for 7 million people. The goal was to promote alternative transportation and reduce smog. If u didn't obey the rules violators were faced with a 25 dollar fine. Soon California and Valledupar joined the no car event. When the countries came to see about the event ta were enthusiastic these people are generating a revolutionary Chang and this is crossing borders said Enrique rear.,0
Ameria has been rapidly dropping the rat of driving the United States peaked in 2005 and dropped steadily in 2013 the number of miles driven per person was 9 percent below the peak and equal to where the country was in January in 1995. Since transportation is the second-largest source of Americas emissions just behind the power plants. But it could have negative implications for the car industry. Companys like ford and Mercedes are already rebranding themselves mobility companies with a broader product range end the personal vehicle.,0
"New York has an Ike sharing program, and it is skyrocketing bridge and tunnel tolls reflect those new priorities as do a proliferation of car sharing programs across the nation. A stud show that driving by young people decreased 23 percent between 2001 and 2009.  ",0
"Some people think that taking classes from home is an easy way to study without having to leave home. While others think that students would not be able to learn as much as they would attending to school. For some this is a big deal while others justify this as a modern way to study. Technology could be helpful for some but not everyone in terms of studying. Most people think that schools should not adopt such way of education. People say that this is not the best way for study. The reasons people say that studying from is not a good way to study, is because students would not be inspired to do their work, not everyone has access to internet, teachers would help the students more in person That through a computer.",0
One of the reasons people are saying that studying from home is not a good idea that students would not be inspired. Meaning that being studying from home they would not have the same environment as in school. Assisting to school would help students to focus on what they do. They would do better seeing other students working. Walking around school during free time and seeing projects made by others students could help students to be more creative. Talking to others students and sharing experiences would make students to put more effort. People say that an inspired mind creates great things.,0
Another reason people argue is because not everyone has access to internet. Either due to economic or others type of reasons not everyone counts with access to a computer. Having some students taking classes from home while others who also want but can not because they do not have access to Internet does not seem good. Some students have to work in order to either pay their bills or buy things that they need and can not afford to have an internet source. There could be paces where getting good,0
Internet connection could be tough because of the location or weather. This issue has people saying that access to internet is a problem when it comes to study from home.,0
One more reason is than teachers would help the students more in person than through the computer. Talking to though computer is not the same as talking in person. People say that students would best understand things their teachers teach them in person because they would explain with more details. Some also say that interacting with the teacher would help students confidence and learning. Some teachers have different way to teach and help the student to fully understand the topics. Students would experiment best learning by having their teacher in front of them or by their side.,0
"Meanwhile, people still argue about this issue and that should be a way to solve it. Attending classes from is not away a good idea because students would not be inspired, not everyone has access to internet, and teachers would help students more in person. With all said we can conclude that the best way to study is by attending to school and no from home.",0
"The advent of social media has revolutionized the way we communicate and share information. With a few clicks, we can connect with friends and family from around the world, share our thoughts and experiences, and stay up-to-date on the latest news and trends. However, this increased connectivity has come with a cost: the loss of privacy. As a result, there is a growing need for stronger privacy protections on social media platforms.",1
"On one hand, proponents of stronger privacy protections argue that social media companies have a responsibility to protect their users' personal information. This includes everything from basic contact information to more sensitive data such as credit card numbers and medical records. Without adequate safeguards in place, this information could be accessed by hackers, identity thieves, and other malicious actors, putting users at risk of financial fraud or even physical harm.",1
"Furthermore, social media platforms often collect and use personal data for targeted advertising purposes. While this can be beneficial for both users and advertisers, it raises concerns about the potential for abuse. For example, if a user's data is used to target them with political ads, they may be more susceptible to manipulation or misinformation. In some cases, this could even undermine the integrity of democratic processes.",1
"On the other hand, opponents of stronger privacy protections argue that social media users should be responsible for managing their own privacy settings and sharing only the information they are comfortable with. They argue that users have the freedom to choose which platforms they use and how much personal information they share, and that it is not the responsibility of social media companies to police this behavior.",1
"Additionally, some argue that stronger privacy protections could stifle innovation and limit the potential benefits of social media. For example, if social media companies are required to obtain explicit consent before collecting or using personal data, they may be less able to develop new features or services that rely on this data.",1
"In conclusion, while there are valid arguments on both sides of the debate, I believe that stronger privacy protections are needed on social media platforms. The potential risks of data breaches and misuse are simply too great to ignore, and social media companies have a responsibility to protect their users' personal information. At the same time, users should also take steps to manage their own privacy settings and be mindful of the information they share online. By working together, we can create a safer and more secure social media environment for all.",1
"Driverless Cars is a great idea, these cars would make a huge change in the world because these cars would be really helpful, but there are some advantages and disavenges of the use of these cars, one advantages is that can drive by themselves, but a disadvantage is that if the sensors don't work what would happen?.",0
"Driverless cars would be really helpful for people and mostly for people that travel a lot they fall sleep, these cars would help them by taking control and so no one get hurt. Driverless cars have sensors that help to create a 3-D model of the car's surroundings, so this would help the car to see if there is any danger and if the is the car will notify the driver to take over and take another options. Cars like these are a great idea, it will allow the drivers to take a rest when they are tired.",0
"Cars like driverless cars are not perfect, and they are not 100 percent safe, these cars can be really expensive too and not everyone would buy them. About safety the sensors that these cars use what if they don't work? What would it happen? If the sensors don't work the cars will not alert the driver if there is any danger and this will end up in an accident and would not be good for the manufacturer and the owner, these were some reasons why the manufacturers want to put cameras in the cars, so the car can see the driver and know whether the driver can drive or cannot drive.",0
"Some manufacturers like GM they have developed driver's seats that vibrate when the vehicle is in danger. Other car that tells the driver when they should take over the car is the Google car. Cameras in cars can help a lot because while the driver is watching the road the car is watching the driver. Some manufacturers are considering bringing entertainment for these cars and information system that use heads-up displays. Such displays can be turned off when the driver needs to take over. This new technology in cars is perfect, but how much these will cost? No one knows yet. I strongly agree with to develop of the driverless cars because this will really help people and will help to reduce the cars accidents.",0
"Driverless cars are definitely are great this new technology will allow the driver to take a rest and then take over any time. The sensors that the cars have help to avoid any danger. Mercedes-Benz, Audi, and Nissan plan to have these new cars drive themselves by 2020, the cars they try to make will be the best option to have fewer cars accidents in the future.",0
I disagree with the statement that in twenty years there will be fewer cars in use than there are today. I think that there will be more cars in use in twenty years than there are today.,1
"There are a few reasons why I think this will be the case. First, the population is growing. More people means more cars. Second, the population is getting older. Older people are more likely to own a car than younger people. Third, cars are becoming more affordable. More people can afford to buy a car than ever before.",1
"There are a few reasons why cars might become less popular in twenty years. First, the cost of owning a car is rising. Cars are becoming more expensive to maintain and to fuel. Second, alternative modes of transportation are becoming more popular. People are choosing to bike or walk more often than they used to. Third, self-driving cars are becoming more common. This could lead to a decrease in the number of cars on the road.",1
"Despite these potential factors, I think that there will be more cars in use in twenty years than there are today. The population is growing, the population is getting older, and cars are becoming more affordable. These factors will outweigh the potential factors that could lead to a decrease in the number of cars on the road.",1
The reason why there is the technology of people to know how to understand on how the reason the pot rites are in this world today. By showing on how the way the pictures in the text is showing how she is smiling. I think we should leave her face the way is originally on the way it is from the way the marginal person painted it. It is being very respectful on how the painting is being displayed in different muse mes here around the world.,0
"The reason why I think this is that let's say that we painted something and someone goes in and paint it completely different. Then what you made it to be in the first place. So I feel like we all should leave things they were when they were created. The respect we give we get in return from the same reason y we gave it to others because the more you give, the more it looks good on you in the long run. So just remember that the next time you see someone changing someone else's painting or others works. They work so hard on because why would they work so hard on something that someone else is just going to go back in and change it.  ",0
" Summer vacations are an essential break for students to recharge and refresh their minds. It is an opportunity for them to spend time with their families, take a break from school, and engage in activities that they enjoy. However, some educators believe that summer vacations should be shorter, and students should be required to attend school year-round. In this essay, I will argue that summer vacations should be longer and that reducing them would have negative consequences for students' mental and emotional well-being.",1
"First, summer vacations provide students with much-needed rest and relaxation. School can be stressful, and students often feel overwhelmed with work and responsibilities. Summer vacation offers a chance for students to unwind and recharge. This is especially important for students who have experienced bullying, stress, or academic failure. They need time to process their emotions and reflect on their experiences. Reducing summer vacation would mean that these students would not have the opportunity to take a break and focus on their mental health.",1
"Second, summer vacations allow students to pursue their interests and hobbies. Many students use their summer vacation to take up new activities or pursue their passions. This can be an excellent opportunity for them to learn new skills and develop their talents. Reducing summer vacation would mean that students would not have the time to engage in these activities, and their personal growth would be stunted.",1
"Third, summer vacations provide students with the opportunity to work and earn money. Many students use their summer vacation to get a job and save money for college or other expenses. This can be an excellent way for them to gain work experience and develop valuable skills. Reducing summer vacation would mean that students would not have the opportunity to work and earn money, and their financial stability would be compromised.",1
"In conclusion, summer vacations are an essential part of the educational experience. They provide students with much-needed rest and relaxation, allow them to pursue their interests and hobbies, and provide them with the opportunity to work and earn money. Reducing summer vacation would have negative consequences for students' mental and emotional well-being, personal growth, and financial stability. Therefore, it is crucial that educators and policymakers recognize the importance of summer vacations and work to ensure that they are long enough to provide students with the benefits they need.",1
"Hey, so I'm going to write this essay about how having a good attitude can be super important, even when things are tough. Like, I know it can be easy to get down when stuff isn't going your way, but if you have a good attitude, it can make all the difference.",1
"First, having a good attitude can make you successful. Like, if you're always positive and stuff, people are gonna want to be around you and stuff. They're gonna wanna work with you and stuff, 'cause you're going to be fun to be around. And that means you're going to have more opportunities, 'cause people are gonna want to help you out and stuff. And that's how you get ahead in life, right?",1
"And it's not just about getting ahead, it's also about being strong. When things are tough, if you have a good attitude, you can handle it. You can be like, ""Yeah, this is tough, but I can do it."" And then you can do it, 'cause you believe in yourself. And that's when you're at your strongest, when you're like, ""I can handle anything.""",1
"And it's not just about you, it's also about how you can help others. When you have a good attitude, you're more likely to help people out, 'cause you're in a good mood and stuff. And that's when you can make a difference in people's lives, 'cause you're being nice and stuff. And that's when you can make a real impact, 'cause you're not just thinking about yourself, you're thinking about others too.",1
"And let me tell you, it's not just like, ""Oh, good attitudes are nice and stuff."" It's like, they can lead to amazing experiences. Like, if you have a good attitude, you're more likely to take risks and stuff, and that's when you can have the most fun. And that's when you can have the best experiences, 'cause you're not just stuck in one place, you're out there doing stuff and living life.",1
"So, like, let me give",1
"This Facial Action Coding System could be good in a couple ways but it's unnecessary. Computers might know what your emotions and help in a couple ways to know if you're confused about something or do not like something you see on the internet. Just because you look at someone's face, it doesn't mean that they feel some type of way. Someone could be smiling or laughing, but that doesn't mean that they are truly happy. It's the same thing by having a serious face.",0
"A face expression doesn't always show someone's emotions. Other people do not care about other people's emotions. It's better to notice things with your own eyes than a computer or machine to tell you how somebody is ""feeling"". The article says you can tell how a friend is feeling by just looking at their face. That's true because you know that person very well.",0
People do want to hide their emotions for their own specific reason. We all have that moment when we would want to keep our feelings to ourselves. We wouldn't like for systems to know our emotions.,0
" I believe that having a positive attitude is essential in life. In my experience, maintaining a positive outlook has helped me achieve many of my goals and enjoy the good things that come my way. I have learned to always look on the bright side, even in difficult situations, and to be grateful for what I have. This has helped me to attract positive energy and opportunities into my life.",1
"One of the benefits of having a positive attitude is that it allows you to give advice and support to others. When you approach people with a positive attitude, they are more likely to respond in kind. This can lead to a cycle of positivity and support, where both parties feel uplifted and motivated.",1
"It's also important to remember that life is unpredictable, and that sometimes things may not go as planned. However, instead of dwelling on the negatives, it's important to focus on the present moment and make the most of the situation. This can help you find new opportunities and learn from your mistakes.",1
"Overall, I believe that having a positive attitude is key to living a fulfilling and successful life. By focusing on the positive, you can attract good things into your life and make a difference in the lives of those around you.",1
"On that faithful June afternoon, the school bell rings for its last time in three months. Students rush out of their classes and greet the summer with open arms. Of course, once school opens up again in August, many of these students have forgotten what they learned the previous year. Many schools assign projects to complete over the summer in order to keep their students' minds sharp; however, there are debates whether the teachers or the students should design the projects. Summer projects should be teacher-designed, so students can properly develop the tools that will help them succeed the following year.",0
"Teacher-designed projects will set the rigor of the class, so students know what to expect. It is most likely that the teacher that assigns the project will be the one instructing the class. If teachers design the project, they can set the guidelines for the year in their summer assignment, so students are not caught off guard. This is especially important for higher level classes such as honors or AP; it is best that all students are aware of the class' expectations, so they can develop their skills as necessary for the course. Students can also decide whether the class is right for them, whether it be because it is too rigorous, not rigorous enough, or simply because the subject does not interest them. This way there is less fuss during the school year as students try to switch their classes.",0
"Teacher-designed projects can allow the students to grow their academic independence. During the school year, teachers are readily available in case students need to answer questions. However, during the summer it is not as easy as raising one's hand in class; students are almost entirely on their own. They will have to develop the skills needed to solve a novel problem independently. This ability is referred to by psychologists as fluid intelligence. One's fluid intelligence decreases with age, so it is important for students to strengthen it while they are young. Students may also find useful academic tools that help them to understand the material of the class. One of the more well known of these tools is Khan Academy. Students often go to these websites to understand what they could not in class. Finding these tools during the summer will prove useful, as they can still be used during the school year.",0
"While student input is important, the teachers are more likely to give projects that are closer in rigor and content to the actual class. Teachers have been trained both in teaching that the subject that they teach, so they likely know the best way to prepare students for what lies ahead. This is why summer projects should be designed by teachers rather than students.",0
"Community service is a hot topic in schools these days, with many schools requiring students to complete a certain number of hours of community service in order to graduate. While some people think this is a great way to teach students the value of giving back to their community, others argue that it takes away from the time students could be spending on academics. In this essay, I'll explore the pros and cons of requiring community service, and suggest a potential solution that takes into account the needs of all parties involved.",1
"One of the biggest pros of requiring community service is that it teaches students important life skills, such as empathy, teamwork, and problem-solving. By giving students the opportunity to help others, they learn how to work together towards a common goal and develop a sense of social responsibility. Additionally, community service can help students develop a sense of purpose and direction, which can be especially important for students who may be struggling with academic or personal issues.",1
"On the other hand, some people argue that requiring community service takes away from the time students could be spending on academics. This is a valid concern, as students who are required to complete many community service hours may fall behind in their schoolwork or struggle to keep up with their academic responsibilities. Additionally, some students may not have access to community service opportunities, either because they live in areas with limited options or because they have other commitments such as work or family responsibilities.",1
"So, what's the solution? One potential solution is to require community service, but to also provide students with flexible options that can be tailored to their individual needs. For example, students could be allowed to choose from a variety of community service projects, such as volunteering at a local animal shelter, participating in a beach cleanup, or helping out at a food bank. This way, students can choose an activity that they are passionate about and that fits their schedule and interests.",1
"Another potential solution is to provide students with academic credit for their community service hours. This way, students can earn credits towards their graduation requirements while still fulfilling their community service obligations. This could be especially helpful for students who are struggling to balance their academic and community service responsibilities.",1
"In conclusion, while there are both pros and cons to requiring community service, a potential solution is to provide students with flexible",1
"The author of ""The Challenge of Exploring Venus"" does not do a good job of supporting their idea. The author believes that, while Venus is dangerous it is worthy of spending time and money to explore this planet. The author mentions the similarities between earth and Venus, makes exploring this planet so fascinating. The author later goes on to explain how NASA would travel and explore Venus, and what tools they would use to explore Venus. How NASA would travel to Venus is reevaluate to if Venus is worth exploring. Because, the author spends a majority of their time telling us how, NASA would learn more about Venus. Is not needed to prove and explain why exploring Venus is pessary.",0
"The author spends three of their six body paragraphs explaining how NASA would explore the planet of Venus. In paragraph 6 they explain that sending an orbiting ship around the planet will provide limited insight of the ground below, and the only way to gain more knowledge is to be able to collect rock and gas samples. The author never states what we could possible learn from the rock samples, or even celebrates on the idea of collecting a variety of samples from the planet. They later spend paragraph 7 explaining the history of computers and how much computes have progressed since 1800. They even explain the mechanics of computers during the World War II for example, ""these devices make calculations by using gear and levers and do not require electronics at all."" The mechanics of computers has nothing to do with the idea that we should be exploring NASA. The information provided in paragraph 5 through 7, such as the history and mechanics of computers. The little information given on how a rock sample will help us learn about Venus, or that NASA isn't able to gain enough information from sending a hovering ship about the planet, do not help or support the authors claim that Venus is worthy of exploring despite the dangers.",0
"To summarize, the author of ""The Challenge of Exploring Venus""",0
"Does not do a good job of explaining why Venus is worthy is studying and exploring, despite the dangers. The author spends too much time explaining computers, the history and the mechanics of them, and what we could learn about Venus through computers. They also use their time to tell their readers that sending an orbiting ship around plant won't provide us with enough information, and to explain how they would explore Venus and the tools they would use. The author did a poor job of explaining the importance of exploring Venus despite the dangers.  ",0
Title: The Joy of Swimming,1
"Hey there, it's me, [Your Name], an average 8th grader, here to share my thoughts on why swimming is an enjoyable activity. I know, I know, it's not everyone's cup of tea, but trust me, it should be! 😊",1
"First off, let's talk about the benefits of swimming. It's a full-body workout that can improve your cardiovascular health, increase your strength and flexibility, and even help with weight management. Plus, it's low-impact, so it's easier on your joints compared to other high-impact sports. And, did you know that swimming can help prevent injuries? It's like a natural injury prevention program! 🤯",1
"Now, I know some people might think swimming is boring, but let me tell you, it's not! 😅 I mean, have you ever tried swimming laps in a pool? It's like a whole different world! You can swim with friends, play games like ""Marco Polo,"" or even just splash around and have fun. And, if you're lucky, you might even see some cool sea creatures like fisfishes dolphins! 🐟🐬",1
"Personally, I love swimming because it's a great way to relax and unwind. When I'm in the water, all my worries just melt away, and I feel so free! Plus, it's a great way to get some exercise without even realizing it. I mean, have you ever tried swimming a mile? It's exhausting, but in a good way! 😅",1
"Swimming has also had a big impact on my life. Growing up, my family didn't have a pool, so I never thought I'd be able to learn how to swim. But, my parents signed me up for swim lessons, and it was one of the best decisions they ever made! 🌟 Not only did I learn how to swim, but I also made some amazing friends and developed a newfound appreciation for the water.",1

"Dear Principal,",1
"I am writing to you today to discuss a matter of great importance to me and my fellow students. I believe that students who have a B average or higher should be allowed to play sports and participate in activities. Furthermore, I understand that there are rules and regulations in place to ensure that students are maintaining their academic performance, but I believe that there is more to life than just academics.",1
"As an eighth-grade student, I have learned the importance of trying hard and making good decisions. It is not enough to just get good grades, but it is also important to be involved in extracurricular activities. Participating in sports and activities can help students develop important skills such as teamwork, leadership, and communication. It can also help students build self-esteem and confidence.",1
"I understand that some students may struggle to balance academics with sports and activities, but I believe that it is important for them to try. It is not enough to just give up and focus solely on academics. Students should be encouraged to find a balance and make good decisions about how they spend their time.",1
"I also believe that allowing students to participate in sports and activities can help them achieve their goals. Whether it is getting into college or pursuing a career, participation in extracurricular activities can help students stand out and demonstrate their dedication and commitment.",1
"In conclusion, I believe that students who have a B average or higher should be allowed to play sports and participate in activities. It is important for students to try hard and make good decisions, and participation in extracurricular activities can help them develop important skills and achieve their goals. I urge you to consider this matter and make a decision that will benefit all students.",1

"In my perspective, I believe that when viewing someone's facial, or human emotions it should be visual. I do not agree with the form of technology. By viewing someone's emotions it forms a sense of character which is good with person to person with associating with one another. According to the article, it talks about how the process with technology starts at a 3-D computer of the face which is then known to have 44 muscles which then shows the movement of the face to detect the human emotions. The article continually explains that the facial expressions are what are known to detect the emotions through technology. This ll today is showing you what all a computer can actually do. According to the article they agree on using the technology from what the computer can actually do. In my perspective I think my opinion is the opposite. Your emotions should be detected by another human’s point of view, not by technology. ",0
"The use of Facial Action Coding System (FACS) technology to read students' emotional expressions in the classroom could have both benefits and drawbacks. On one hand, this technology may help teachers understand how their lessons are engaging students on an emotional level. If a teacher notices many students appear bored or confused during a lesson, FACS could provide valuable feedback to improve instruction methods. It could also assist teachers in identifying students who are struggling emotionally but may not express it otherwise. This type of technology could help teachers provide better emotional support to students. ",1
"However, constant monitoring of students' facial expressions with FACS also raises privacy and behavioral issues. Students may feel uncomfortable knowing their emotional reactions are being surveilled and analyzed in real time. This could increase anxiety and discourage natural emotional responses during class. Students should feel free to focus internally on learning without worrying about expressions being screened. Additionally, identifying emotions through facial expressions alone may not provide full context and could result in misinterpretations. A student's expression may not accurately reflect how they internally feel about a lesson.",1
"Overall, while FACS technology aims to give teachers useful insights, its continuous use in the classroom to monitor students risks invading privacy and altering natural classroom behaviors. Teachers could benefit from occasional voluntary emotional check-ins with students, but constant facial monitoring goes too far. More traditional methods of teacher-student communication are generally preferable to validate a student's emotional experience in school. If used sparingly and with consent, this technology may offer value, but broader application could do more harm than good.",1
"From man's very first trip out of Earth's atmosphere to the iconic moon landing, people from all across the world have always wondered what lies in the unknown solar system that surrounds them. Despite the danger and the failures that plagued these early scientists, they still strived to explore space and the planets within it. In writing ""The Challenge of Exploring Venus,"" the author is able to very convincingly explain the benefits of exploring Venus, despite the dangerous challenges this endeavor may present.",0
"The article starts off by describing Venus and providing background for the reader, allowing the writer to make a stronger and more understandable claim later on in the work. Venus, as described in the article, is often the closest planet to Earth, depending on the time, and is repeating called ""Earth's 'twin'"" because of its similarity in size and density to Earth. The author then goes one to describe the multiple missions already taken to Venus, which have all failed in the end.",0
"While the author does state reasons why a mission to Venus could be treacherous, he or she is able to negate these downfalls by listing all the possible benefits of exploring this inhospitable planet. Venus is considered by scientists to be a dangerous planet to explore for many reasons included in the writing.",0
"For one, its temperature far exceeds in heat any which the Earth has reached by hundreds of degrees. The atmosphere of Venus also contains a corrosive acid which would be a great obstacle to any vehicle attempting to pass through. The author then goes on to give multiple other reasons in support of danger, but is finally able to oppose these concerns by listing all the reasons why man kind should explore Venus. For one, Venus is the planet that is most near Earth and therefore will take the shortest time to journey towards. Space travel, the author includes, is very time-consuming and not to be taken on lightly. In addition, scientists believe Venus may have once been exceedingly similar to today's Earth. By giving this information, the author is able to infer that information gained by a trip to Venus could be very much crucial to ensuring the survival of the planet home to a large amount of life. The writing claims, after all of these reasons, that ""the value of returning to Venus seems indisputable,"" despite the hardships explorers would face.",0
"In further support of this claim, the author explains the multiple ways that scientists are testing in order to make a trip to Venus possible. The article shows that already, multiple ideas have been proven to work.",0
"The author of ""The Challenge of Exploring Venus,"" is able to very successfully make the claim that Venus is worth exploring through negation of the dangers of such a trip by providing multiple benefits of a visit and the ways in which scientists have already found to make the trip possible. Exploration is exceedingly valuable to maintaining and improving life on Earth and, as written by the author, ""should not be limited by dangers and doubts.""  ",0
"Every four years since the founding of the United States, a president has been elected by the people to lead the U.S. According to source 1, the system used to select the president is the Electoral College. The Electoral College involves voters voting for president they want, as normal, and then the president that got the majority vote in that state gets all of that state's electoral votes. Supporters of the Electoral College claim that it is good that the presidents focus more on swing states, and that they are more likely to be the thoughtful voters, but there is zero evidence shown to support this, and it makes presidents focus on states disproportionally. The Electoral College should be abolished and replaced by the popular vote system, as it is an outdated method compared to modern technology, makes the vote of an individual seem even more insignificant, and makes presidents not campaign in states that are small or loyal to them.",0
"Since the Electoral College was hundreds of years ago, it does not account for all the new technologies that have been developed since then. The founding fathers could not have possibly thought that it would be possible to easily count all the nation's votes with a machine, but now it is possible. It is likely that the reason they thought of the Electoral College in the first place was because it would mean that they could spread out the tallying of votes between the states, instead of doing it all at once. Nowadays though, there are computers that can count votes faster than ever imagined. Popular vote is now a viable method since every person's vote can be accurately counted.",0
"Due to the Electoral College relying on a majority rules system, the vote of a single person can be completely insignificant. According to source 3, a supporter of the Electoral College, ""Voters in presidential elections are people who want to express a political preference rather than people who think that a single vote may decide an election...."" This should not be the case when voting. Voters should research their choice as if the election relied completely on them. But instead, there is a system in place where somebody's vote can be rendered completely useless in not multiple ways! For example, if a state already has their majority of citizens voting for president A, if somebody votes for president B it will be as if they didn't vote at all! Even in a case where the state is completely 50:50 on whom to give the electoral votes to, if the last person votes for president A, tipping the majority in his favor, according to source 2, ""... those electors could always defy the will of the people,"" and end up voting for President B. The Electoral College is an anti-thesis to democracy, because a citizen's vote can be rendered completely pointless at multiple points.",0
"Both those who support the Electoral College system and those who oppose it agree that the Electoral College puts a much bigger focus on swing states and states with large populations, according to sources 2 and 3. To put this into perspective, here's an example of why supporting big swing states should not be rewarded. The US has 6 states. 5 are completely democrats and each have populations of 20. 1 is half democrat half republican and has a population of 100(assume 20 people equals an electoral vote). If the republican presidential candidate convinces a single democrat in the big state to vote for them, they will get the majority vote in that state and get 5 electoral votes. This results in the democratic presidential candidate, with 149 people supporting him, tying with the republican presidential candidate, with 51 people supporting him. Simple logic shows that the opinion of 149 people is more important than that of 51 people, so a popular vote system would have been best in this situation. The focus on certain states is such a popular method by the presidential candidates, that, according to source 2, ""During the 2000 campaign, seventeen states didn't see the candidates at all..."" Big states and swing states should not receive much more attention per citizen from the presidential candidates than little states do.",0
"In conclusion, the Electoral College should be replaced by the popular vote system as soon as possible. The Electoral College relies on archaic methods to make tallying votes simpler for the government, which results in problems. It's like the government is rounding the votes. The winner-takes-all method of the Electoral College can render a voter's vote completely useless, and it even allows representatives to vote for the presidential candidate that is against the voter's wills. Presidential candidates will not bother campaigning in states that are loyal to their adversary or are too small to be worth their time. While a single person's opinion might not seem important, or rounding votes seems ""easier,"" no corners should ever be cut when deciding who the leader of a nation with over 50 million citizens is, which is why the Electoral College should be replaced by the popular vote system.

"Nowadays, it is widely accepted that having a graduate degree is a prerequisite for career advancement in many institutions. While a degree certificate may reflect one's academic achievements, it does not necessarily reflect all the abilities essential for a successful career. I agree with this statement for the following reasons.",1
"First, having a graduate degree does not guarantee that one has the necessary skills for a successful career. For example, a person with a degree in engineering may not be able to work in a customer service position because he or she lacks the necessary customer service skills.",1
"Second, a degree certificate does not reflect all the abilities that are essential for a successful career. For example, a person with a degree in engineering may be able to work in a customer service position if he or she has the necessary skills, such as communication and problem-solving skills.",1
"Third, a degree certificate may not be relevant to the job that one is applying for. For example, a person with a degree in engineering may not be able to work as a doctor if he or she does not have the necessary medical knowledge.",1
"Fourth, a degree certificate may not be current. For example, a person with a degree in engineering may not be able to work as a doctor if the degree is not up-to-date with the latest medical knowledge.",1
"In conclusion, I believe that a degree certificate does not reflect all the abilities that are essential for a successful career.",1
"How do you feel about students having to do an extracurricular activity? I believe that it would help students be better people. These activities will keep them out of trouble. Extra activities with new people will help improve the social skills of students. Activities such as sports will keep them healthy and active. Do you not want students to be better people for others, and themselves?",0
"First, Students that have an extracurricular activity will stay out of trouble. When a student is doing something good for them self, and they enjoy it, they will not be getting into much trouble. If students are playing a sport they will be motivated to stay healthy and stay away from drugs. Most extracurricular activities require good behavior. Therefore, if a student gets attached to an activity they will do their best to stay out of trouble.",0
"Secondly, Students that less social skills can meet new people. Those students can create strong, long-lasting bonds. Extracurricular activities can give students the friends they need that make them happy. Some friendships are even like family, and those types of bonds are important. We need students to have strong bonds and stronger social skills.",0
"Finally, These activities can keep the students healthy, and active. Sports will have students always moving and keep them in shape. Some activities will teach you about nutrients and how to support your body. Activities like these will keep you healthy and make you feel better about yourself. If everyone participates in these activities than everyone will be happy, healthy, and active.",0
"In conclusion, I believe that extracurricular activities will make students a bigger part of society. These activities will get students to behave. The students will be healthy. The activities will give the students better social skills. That is why I believe that extracurricular activities will make students be better people.",0
"Control your life or let it control you. Since technology has improved significantly since the past decades, In the article ""Driverless Cars Are Coming"" humans are able to create vehicles that drive themselves. They have their pros and cons but the cons out-shape the pros. Driverless cars are lethal, illegal, and time-consuming to manufacture.",0
"The first reason on why driveless cars are lethal is that they are not tested fully and can injure the driver very severely if not handled right. This is evident in paragraph 9 where the author states, ""manufacturers believe that more states will follow as soon as the cars are proved more reliably safe."" This is a perfect example of how the driveless cars are still unstable and should be tested. Overall, companies still need to improve on some aspects on the driveless car to have it be a safe to use.",0
"The second reason is that the utilization of driveless cars on testing is illegal. Evidence to support this claim is that the author states in paragraph 9, ""As a result, in most states it is illegal even to test computer-driven cars."" This makes the invention difficult to find its shortcomings and hard to sell. More evidence is found that a lot of people can get in trouble due to this technology failing, which is found in paragraph nine again, ""If the technology fails and someone is injured, who is at fault-the driver or the manufacturer?"" This can both harm them because of the injury and the company's reputation. Overall, driveless cars are suited to test because of the law.",0
"Finally, the last reasoning on while driveless cars are suited for the market is because of time. It takes a long time to produce; this is stated by the author in paragraph 5, ""Within 10 years, those sensors had become more advanced to detect and respond to the danger of out-of-control skids or rollovers."" It takes the company TEN YEARS to only create one component of the device. Overall, driveless cars take a long time to produce.",0
"Driverless cars can be conducive and negative to the consumer, but the drawbacks out match the pros with It's dangerous to control, legalization, and time-consuming process to manufacture. The technology is not ready yet for this device to hit shelves in markets and is best to wait when there is more money involved for this project.",0
Phones & Driving,0
"Should people be able to use a cellular device while operating a vehicle? Different generations would agree and disagree. Older generation would say ""No, drivers should not be able to use a phone while driving."" While newer generation would say ""Yes, drivers should be able to use a phone while driving."" I believe that drivers should not be able to use a cellular device while operating a vehicle.",0
"Statistics state that 26% of all crashes in 2014 involved cell phone use. 10% of those crashes are teen drivers of the age 15 to 19. Teens are more likely to text and drive because their world is revolved around social media. Because teenagers are young and naïve we believe that we are more capable of multitasking but, history has shown otherwise.",0
"Some people think they are invincible and can't be killed. So, they think can text and drive and not get hurt or face the consequences. People as they get older think they can get away with more stuff like texting and driving, but life hits them with a wake-up call.",0
"In conclusion, do you think drivers should be able to use their cell phone while driving? People need to keep their eyes on the road and on nothing else. They need to stay focused to their surroundings. Texting and driving kills, so be careful on the roads.  ",0
"Dear Senator, ",1
"I am writing to express my view that we should keep the current Electoral College system for electing the President of the United States, rather than change to a popular vote system. There are several important reasons why maintaining the Electoral College is preferable.",1
"First, the Electoral College system encourages candidates to build broader coalitions and campaign in more states. Under a popular vote, candidates would likely focus all their efforts on population centers along the coasts and largely ignore the rest of the country. This could worsen regional divisions. The Electoral College system requires candidates to appeal to a wider range of constituencies across many states. ",1
"However, some argue that the popular vote more directly reflects the will of the people. While it is true that the candidate who wins the national popular vote may sometimes lose the Electoral College, this system has still maintained stability for our country over many elections. It also encourages two viable national political parties and prevents third party candidates from winning with just a small percentage of votes nationwide. Changing to a strictly popular system could undermine this stability.",1
"Additionally, smaller states argue that they would have less influence under a popular vote system. The current framework gives even the least populous states a minimum of three electoral votes, ensuring that candidates must consider their interests too. A national popular vote might diminish the role of smaller, less populated states. ",1
"In conclusion, while the Electoral College system is imperfect, it has served the country reasonably well overall and maintains several advantages over a simple national popular vote. For these reasons, I believe we should retain the current Electoral College framework for now. Let me know if you would like me to elaborate on any part of my argument. Thank you for your consideration.",1

"Part of our current education system provides free childcare to parents in addition to helping longer students developed socially. This is why brick and order schools will always be a necessity for elementary schoolers, but students outside that age range should have the opportunity to demonstrate their responsibility in order to receive the privilege of being taught at home rather than at school because of social distractions, and the general time sink that is school.",0
"All you ever hear about public schools today is bullying, exclusion, and drama that is pointless and distracts students from their academics, the solution is right in front of us, online school. Online school would be superior to traditional brick and Porter school because students would have minimum opportunities to interact with one and other during class which would make classroom control easier for the teacher. In addition to students having minimum opportunities to speak in class, everything that was said during the class could be monitored by the teacher or by an automated program designed to detect any buzzwords, unkind or curse words. The automation could also keep count of the number of times students cursed or said rude things to each other and report these infractions to the teacher. While this process might sound invasive, it isn't anything that teachers don't try to facilitate with physically, now they can do it technologically.",0
"While the in class conversations can defiantly be monitored, there is also out of class social media and texting that could be distracting during online class time, and with no physical adult in the room telling students to put away the phone how could we be sure that we aren't just trading one evil for another? While there are numerous distractions at home that could cause students grades to dip, the solution to this potential problem is that online school would need to be a privilege and not a right. Class time would need to be monitored.",0
"Another benefit of monitored online school is that with fewer distractions the class could move faster which would allow extra time for students to pursue recreational activities, and academic interests-this system would allow students to separate their work time from their play time in a way that is just not possible today. This system of having extra time to dedicate to passions would also be beneficial in incentivizing students to pay attention during class. This system also promotes better friendships by giving students time to pursue interests outside of school-- providing an outlet to meet like-minded people.",0
"While online school isn't a perfect solution, it could change the way that many students view school as a whole. Instead of being forced to sit in a building all day with other kids, we could be at home leaning on our own time with pre-recorded videos. With online schooling students get the opportunity to control their own education, and they are also incentivized to preform well, not because they are competing for spots at some prestigious collage, but because they want their own free time.  ",0
"Are electoral college better than other colleges. Yes i believe that an electoral college is better than other collages because they help pick the Braden and the vice president based on votes, the Electoral collage is consists on 538 votes which majority of 270 electors is required to elect the president.",0
An electoral college is a collage that helps pick candidates that are running for president in are state. The candidates are chosen by the political party. The election is held every 4 years on teethe first Tuesday of November. My second reason electoral collages help are state out are they help pick they right states to vote.,0
"An electoral collage tells there president where to go and give there speeches. Presidebts seems are very important, the speeches give them vote two keep them president in charge. Some on the big voting states are Texas, california, and Florida, so in conclusion you should go two an electoral collage because they help are states out by pick the right president and keeping him.",0
"A growing trend in day to day life that is occurring around the world is ""carefree"" day. Carefree day has spread in cities and towns around Europe and the Americas to separate suburban life from automobile use. This is beneficial in many ways to the growth, forward movement, and health of towns. So far Europe, Asia, and the Americas have given up car usage for a day, and even given up car usage entirely.",0
"Different cities practice carefree day differently. In Paris, the near record pollution was at its height. The city participated in carefree day by enforcing a partial driving ban and making people with even numbered license plates leave their cars at home. The following day, the odd numbered license plates were confined to home. Any person who didn't follow guidelines and conduct was fined. The congestion of smog in the capital of France decreased by sixty percent. Paris typically has more smog than other European capitals, like Brussels and London. By participating in the carefree day, Paris was able to contribute to cutting down the greenhouse gas emissions and temporarily fix a few environmental concerns in Paris. Even though they had some effective results, Paris wasn't the only city that participated in the trend.",0
"Across the Atlantic Ocean in Bogotá, the program allowed Colombians of Bogotá to hike, bike, skate, or take public transportation to work. The carefree day left the normally busy, full and loud streets devoid of traffic jams. The goal to promote alternative transportation and reduce smog was enforced by minor fines. Despite the fact that rain showers were common, it did not stop the people from participating. The people of the town viewed it as a day of taking away stress and lowering AR pollution. The day without cars has been part of an improvement campaign since the mid 1990s, and has since been practiced at least one day out of the year. Authorities from countries all around the world have gone to the event and were impressed and some were inspired. Even other cities that are in Colombia have joined the event like Cali and Valledupar.",0
"Back in Europe, the city of Vauban, Germany, has taken place in a permanent car band. Street parking, driveways, and home garages are nearly forbidden in the experimental and new district of Freiburg. While car ownership is allowed, there are only two places to park. People that live there generally like the way of life in Vauban. Many of them sold their cars just to move there in the first place. The overall feeling of living in a city free of cars seems to lift stress of the people that live there. Therefore, the people are happier and more productive. Vauban is known as the most advanced experiment in attempts to make suburbs more compact and have a minute number of vehicles. Supermarkets and stores as a result have been moved to a closer distance so that they could be walking distance away. Our development as people over the past century had been based on the car, and Vauban goes completely against the idea that progress is based off of the car.",0
"Even in America, Obama is ambitious to change the amount of the United States pollution. While although cities have yet to participate in carefree day, Citizens are buying fewer cars, driving less, and getting fewer licenses across America each year. This gives researchers the idea that America is passed the peak driving level. American life has been integrated with cars from the time that the Model T was born. As the amount of jobs decrease, people just can not afford to buy cars. People in America have lost the general idea of a car and it's uses. Young adults in college have learned to use other ways of transport like carpooling with a friend, public transportation, or walking to the destination. The amount of people has dropped more than twenty percent and still continues to drop. This incipient stage of American life has implied the idea of alternatives to multiple motored vehicles.",0
"Cities all around the world are deciding to practice their own car free day and are decreasing the use of cars altogether. The practice of carefree day has caused parks to initiate, sidewalks to be prepared repaired, cut traffic, give joy to the people, and overall diminish air pollution.",0
"I recently decided to take a closer look at the different subjects taught in elementary schools across the country. To better understand how the learning process takes place, I talked with current teachers about their teaching styles and techniques for engaging students. I also researched different ways to make lessons interesting and engaging. I asked family members and friends about their own elementary school experiences – what they enjoyed and found difficult.",1
"Furthermore, I wanted to observe students in an elementary school to see how they interact and learn, so visited an elementary school in my area. It was fascinating to observe how the children absorbed the knowledge and interacted with each other. Afterwards, I learned about different activities and games which could be exciting for elementary school students. With this in mind, I prepared a lesson plan for teaching an elementary school subject.",1
"Hello, my name is Luke Merger, and I am a Seagoing Cowboy. The Seagoing Cowboys took care of the horses, young cows, and mules that were shipped across the ocean. My friend, Don, and I signed up. I think you should sign up for the Seagoing Cowboys program, because you could save a life.",0
"The Seagoing Cowboys help people in need, especially after World War ll, it feels so nice to help people in need, if you sign up you could feel it, too. Since we ship animals and take care of them around the world, we provide people with good livestock, that maybe, could save a life! And, if you're bored, the animals keep you busy. Also, there is some incredible sightseeing around the world.",0
"Another reason you would want to sign for the Seagoing Cowboys program is you could see some truly, incredible things! Besides helping people, I had the benefit of seeing Europe and China! I saw some beautiful things like, the Acropolis in Greece, taking the gondola ride in Italy, that has streets of water, I toured an excavated castle in Crete, and I loved the Panama Canal when I was on my way to China. That may be beautiful, but if you still aren't convinced, the danger that it puts in your life makes your heart pump!",0
"My third reason, is the danger and heart-skipping-a-beat experiences that this program gives you! If you're bored with your life, think about the Seagoing Cowboys program. The reason I say this, is one rainy night, after I made my hourly report to my captain, I suddenly slid down a slippery ladder on my back. I would've fallen off, if it wasn't for a strip of metal that caught me! I would have been in the deep water of the Atlantic by now. Furthermore, I felt happy to be alive, and I will never forget that moment.",0
"My last reason is that I had so much fun, and it was a truly amazing, never-forgetting experience. On return trips we played games in the hold where the animals were. We played baseball, volleyball, and other games like table-tennis, fencing, boxing, and more, that got us ready for our next adventure. This program gave me a better-than-amazing experience, and I would love to share it with you!",0
"Now, I should conclude my thoughts. You should sign up for the Seagoing Cowboys, so you could help people in need, see amazing things, such as the Acropolis in Greece, so you can have a dangerous but amazing life, and so you can have fun and have a never forgetting experience. Sign up for the Seagoing Cowboys, now!",0

"If you do community service and help people then you might not get rewards the same day, but you will get something good. Helping the less fortune or the deaf and blind. Even if the deaf couldn't hear what you said, they can see what you said. What if one day our world is being run by a deaf man or woman, and the reason their all the way at the top is because of you. You help them to read, and they grow up to become president just because you took time out of your life to help them. Overall I think doing community service might be a drag, but it's the right thing, and you help one or even more lives.",0

"Many people have been debating on the topic of which skill of English is more important for Chinese learners. In this article, I would like to share my opinion on this topic.",1
"I believe that speaking and reading are the most important skills for a Chinese learner. However, it is important to remember that there are many other skills that are also important, such as listening, speaking, writing, and so on. It is very difficult to learn all of these skills at the same time, so it's better to focus on one skill at a time. For example, if you want to be able to read and write Chinese, you should first learn to speak and read Chinese. If you don't have the time to do both, then you can focus more on reading and less on speaking. The same goes for listening. You can learn Chinese by listening to a lot of different kinds of Chinese music, but you won't be fluent in Chinese unless you also learn how to listen to Chinese radio, TV, movies, etc. This is a very important skill to have, because it will help you to understand Chinese culture better and will make it easier to communicate with other Chinese people. So, in the end, learning English and speaking Chinese are not mutually exclusive. They are two different skills, each with its own advantages and disadvantages.",1
"Math is an essential part of our daily lives, and it has been an important part of mine too. I have always found math to be a fascinating subject, and I believe it has played a significant role in shaping my life.",1
"One of the most obvious ways' math is used in daily life is in financial transactions. For example, when I buy groceries at the store, I need to calculate the total cost of my items, including taxes and any discounts I might be eligible for. Math is also used in budgeting and saving money, which are essential skills for financial stability.",1
"Another place where math is used in daily life is in technology. Math is the foundation of many technological devices, including computers, smartphones, and cars. Without math, these devices would not be able to perform the complex calculations required to function properly. For example, when I use my GPS to navigate to a new location, the device uses math to calculate the shortest route based on current traffic conditions.",1
"Math is also used in science and engineering. For example, when scientists design new drugs or medical devices, they use math to calculate the properties of the substance and ensure it is safe for use. Engineers use math to design bridges, buildings, and other structures, ensuring they are safe and efficient.",1
"In terms of preparing for success in the future, math is a crucial subject. Many careers require a strong foundation in math, including engineering, science, and finance. Additionally, math skills are transferable to many other subjects, such as physics, computer science, and even art.",1
"However, math is not always perceived positively by others. Some people view math as a difficult and tedious subject, while others see it as a necessary evil. However, I believe that math is an essential skill that everyone should have, regardless of their interests or career goals.",1
"In conclusion, math is an essential part of our daily lives, and it has been an important part of mine too. Math is used in financial transactions, technology, science, and engineering, and it is essential for success in many careers. While math may not be perceived positively by everyone, I believe it is an essential skill that everyone should have.",1
Imagine you are about to head into summer break and your teacher assigns a summer project that you aren't interested in. Some students believe they should be able to design their own project. Although some say teachers should be responsible for designing summer projects. Actually students should be able to design summer projects to fit what they do during summer.,0
Those who believe teachers should design summer projects have their reasons. They believe teachers should design summer projects because it will keep students occupied over the summer. Teachers would be able to control what their students do and hopefully keep their minds fresh for the following year. Teachers don't think students should be able to control what their project is on because it could lead them off track or students wouldn't take it serious.,0
"Actually, students should be able to design their own summer projects because they would be able to base it off their summer vacation. Students would be more engaged in what they are doing because they would be able to do what they are interested in but still be learning new material or review on what they had learned in the past year. This would keep students thinking about their project and make it fun for them to do.",0
"Another reason is students would be able to base their project on what they do for the summer. For example if a student was going to the Cayman Islands they could make their project fit in to what he or she does. This would stop students from stressing and pushing away from doing the project. The project wouldn't entirely be made up by the students. There would still be limitations like the material you would choose to do your project on, so students will still have to put in effort. This helps Students have fun on vacation while getting a head start for the next year.",0
"In conclusion students should be able to design their own projects, so they would still be able to enjoy their vacation without stressing over school. Students would be able to show creativity and positive learning skills for the upcoming year. I think all summer projects should be student designed to encourage students to learn to be creative and happy with what they are doing.",0
"For a long time now we have been fighting against global warming and solution. Some people why we can't just end the fight quickly. And the reason is simply because we still rely so much on cars. All people need to find so type of way to stop using cars as much. There are some places that are already starting to limit uses. Like in Vauban, Germany who has a ban on cars, Paris, France who can use certain cars on certain days, and Bogota, Colombia.",0
"One way people could limit their use of cars is if they did something like what Vauban, Germany did. Build cities that had no driveways and no parking lots. That way people had to buy parking large spots that cost a lot of money. According to source one passenger cars are responsible for twelve percent of greenhouse emissions in Europe. Many will think this is not a lot but think about how much solution there is, then find out how twelve percent is it will be a lot. But when these types of cities are made there will be a reduced in the emissions because little if any cars we be driven here. In source one Hadron Walter said ""When I had a car I was always tense. I'm much happier this way."" This shows that without cars in people life it removes a tremendous amount of stress. People don't have to worry about spending money on gas, or they don't have to worry about paying large amounts of money for their car to be fit. When there is not so much money at stake you tend to be a little less tense. Obviously creating a city were you have to buy a parking garage spot to hold your car would be a great idea because it would reduce the amount of solution being released, and it would make the people living in the city less stressed.",0
"Another ways people could limit the use of cars is if they do something like Paris, France does. They placed a ban on cars with odd numbered license plates on Mondays, And placed a ban on cars with even numbered license plates on Tuesdays. They did this because they were having record-breaking amounts of solution being released. Furthermore, they were releasing more solution than Beijing, China who is the leading city in solution. But according to article two Paris found a sixty percent decrease in solution in just five days of this even odd ban. This means they lost more than half of the cities solution by limiting the cars on Monday to only even license and limiting the cars to only odd license on Tuesday. Clara this is a very effective method of reducing the amount of cars being used.",0
"A third way cars could be used less is if you have no car days like Bogota, Colombia has. In article three Carlos Arturo Plaza says ""It's a good way to take away stress and lower air solution."" He is saying that cars a cause for solution and doing this day is a good way of lowering solution rates. This source also stated that other cities in Columbia like Cali and Valledupar are joining in this event. It is also said that other country leaders go to Colombia to watch this event. Afterwards they say the event is awesome. This means that not only is the event spreading across Colombia, but it could possibly spread to other countries as well. Without a doubt this is another effective way to limit the use of cars.",0
"It is clear that cars are a problem. But many people use them anyway, but what they don't think about is how much they are contributing to solution. Some ways to limit car usage are created cities where you have to pay for a place to store you car, have and even odd license day, and have no car days. So now the choice is yours will you continue driving all the time, or will you limit the amount you drive?  ",0
"When peoples ask for advices, they sometime talks to more than one person. Seeking multiples opinions can help someone make a better choice. First, getting more than one point of view can help you see the problem from different angels. For example, if you're asking for advices on what college to go to, one person might say go to Harvard because it's the best school in the country. But another person might say go to a community college first to save money. If you only talk to one person, you might not of thought about the money issue. But with multiple opinions, you can see that there are different ways to look at the problem.",1
"Another reason seeking multiples opinions can help is that people have different experiences. For example, if you're asking for advices on how to deal with a bully, one person might say just ignore them. But another person might say, no, that's not a good idea, you should stand up to them. If you only talk to one person, you might not of thought about standing up to the bully. But with multiple opinions, you can see that there are different ways to deal with the problem.",1
"Finally, seeking multiples opinions can help you make a decision that you won't regret. For example, if you're asking for advices on whether to drop out of school, one person might say yes, it's a good idea because you can make more money working. But another person might say no, it's a bad idea because you won't have a degree. If you only talk to one person, you might not of thought about the long term effects. But with multiple opinions, you can see that there are different ways to look at the problem and make a decision that you won't regret.",1
"In conclusion, seeking multiples opinions can help someone make a better choice because it allows you to see the problem from different angels, people have different experiences, and it helps you make a decision that you won't regret. So next time you need advice, don't be afraid to ask more than one person.",1
"In paragraph 2 it was stated that Google cars aren't truly driverless. Also in paragraph 7 it was said that none of the cars developed so far are completely driverless and humans need to stay alert to take over the wheel. Finally, in paragraph 9 it asks who would be responsible if technology fails. I'm against driverless cars.",0
"Humans need to know how to drive a car for simple actions. In paragraph 2 it says divers sometimes need to take over when pulling in and out of driveways or dealing with complicated traffic issues, such as roadwork or accidents.",0
"Stated in paragraph 7 none of the cars developed so far are completely driverless and humans need to stay alert. Human need to know how to drive a car in case technology fails or an emergency. If a human doesn't know how to drive a car and relies on the car, and you're in a dangerous situation, then the driver and passengers are most likely to be killed. A human needs to know how to navigate through work zones and around accidents. The Google Car simply announces when the driver should be prepared to take over.",0
"Safety is the number one most important thing when being in a car. It's the drivers job to make sure everyone in the car and themselves is safe. If someone is injured or technology fails, who is at fault-the driver or the manufacture? Traffic laws are written with the assumption that the only safe car has a human driver in control at all times.",0
"I'm against driverless cars because Google cars aren't truly driverless, humans need to stay alert to take over the wheel, and who would be responsible if technology fails.",0
"""All of our development since World War II has been centered on the car, and that will have to change."" David Goldberg. Automobiles have been a major impact on today's technology. The creation of the car was a huge turning point in history. Even though this machine has been such an amazing creation, it still causes a lot of damage in society. Cars affect both the environment and humans. The limit of car usage would be great because then the amount of pollution would decrease, less traffic would occur, and it makes way for alternative transportation opportunities.",0
"In the United States, the Environmental Protection Agency is promoting ""car reduced"" communities. The reduction of cars can lead to the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions. According to Elisabeth Rosenthal, cities are choking due to the increase number of emissions. Paris had hit near record pollution which lead to an enforced ban of partial driving to clear the air of the global city. According to Robert Duffer, Paris typically has more smog than other European capital. In Bogotá, Colombia there is a day called Day Without Cars, there they only let buses and taxis drive around, and their goal is to promote alternative transportation and reduce smog. If anybody goes against this, they would have to pay 25. ""It's a good opportunity to take away stress and lower air pollution,"" said businessman Carlos Arturo Plaza. This day became huge in Colombia and improved their cities overall look.",0
"Furthermore, the limitation of car usage would decrease the amount of traffic. Traffic is an ongoing issue in everyday life. People arrive late to work or school or wherever they need to go due to traffic or an accident. During the Day Without Cars in Colombia, millions of Colombians hiked, biked, skated, or took buses, leaving the city devoid of traffic jams. Traffic jams are usually stressful so if that gets reduced with the limitation of car usage, then stress levels get reduced as well, causing mentally healthier people. Traffic jams also occur due to accidents. Car accidents are one of the many reasons why people end up in hospitals, get sued, get hurt, or loose money. With the limitation of car usage, all these issues will be resolved.",0
"Moreover, new alternative transportation vehicles can come into play with the reduction on car usage. There is a plan where they want suburbs to play a much larger role in a new six year federal transportation bill to be approved. Also, during the Day Without Cars, the goal is to promote alternative transportation. Lately, new transportation vehicles have been discovered and created. Some include, a flying car, an elevated train that gets you from point A to point B in seconds, and new hybrid cars. Technology keeps progressing every single day. Today people may be driving their normal SUVs but by tomorrow, they could be driving the new high speed flying Ferrari. People are always keeping in mind while creating these machines about how it will affect the community and the consumers. Since it is obvious that the environment isn't as healthy as it was before, they must make sure that these machines limit pollution and emissions that affect the world negatively.",0
"Overall, the limit of car usage would be a good thing. As time goes on people may not even need cars anymore to move from place to place. If everyone works together to solve these issues then the world would become a much better place. The final goal is to get rid of all the bad emissions and issues and just stick to what is best for the environment. When the environment is healthy, the humans are healthy.",0
Phones And Driving,0
"Why should people use their phones if they are operating a vehicle? It is dangerous for someone driving a vehicle to use their phones because it can cause an accident. People should not use their phones while driving. People use their phones to text, answer phone calls, and to make plans. You can not do two things at once everybody uses their phones instead of paying attention to the road. You should always drive safe and make sure you stop at every traffic light. Furthermore, you should have drive at the speed limit. No car should ever go 100mph on the interstate or on a busy street. It will be hard to stop your car at a red light if you are going 100 mph. You will most likely get pulled over or get into a car accident if going that fast.",0
"One reason you should not use your phone while driving is texting. One day you can be driving your car, and you will get a text message from someone. That person will look at their phone and pick it up and start texting back. They will be all into their phone and not paying attention to the road. He or she will be trying to text back and pay attention to their phone and the road at the same time. They can be driving and slam on the brakes and the car behind them can hit them from behind and that caused an accident all because that person was trying to text someone back. You should not text and drive at all. That is so dangerous if you drive looking at your phone. Its a lot of things that can happen when you are using your phone while driving vehicle. If you want to be on the phone with somebody while driving car you should get somewhere you can stick your phone in and talk to that person. You can also get pulled over by the police when using your phone while driving.",0
"Picking up your phone to answer a phone call could also be dangerous. If you have to answer a phone call you should pull to the side of the road or wait to call that person back. Driving with your phone in you hand is dangerous because you will be busy trying to answer a phone call and not looking at the road. Your best option is to pull to the side of the road and answer the phone instead of driving with it in your hand. You can also get some earbuds to put in your ear, so you won't have to answer the phone with your hand. Holding a phone or tablet in your hand while driving is so dangerous. You can have a phone is your hand, but you will try to turn the steering wheel, and you will not make a perfect turn. So it is best for you to not have no phone in your hand. If you are driving a car and somebody behind you on their phone. Both of you people will get to a traffic light and the light will be red and you and the person will slam on brakes and most likely you will hit another car and the car behind you will hit your car. It will be your fault that you were on your phone and not paying attention to the road. Then you will most likely go to jail if that person you hit die. Depending on how bad that person is hurting you can get like 5 years in jail probably more than that. Everybody in this world need to just stop texting and driving.",0
Some people use their phones and look up at the road at the same time that is dangerous to.,0
"Nobody should make plans while driving a vehicle. Some people make plans while on the phone with someone or typing it in their notes, so they won't forget. When making plans you should do that while you are at home. Making plans while driving a car can make you not focus on driving because you are trying to make plans. For example, you and a friend is in the car your friend is talking to you about going somewhere, and you are trying to listen to what she is saying and focus on driving that is not safe at all. Your friend should wait until you stop somewhere to make plans. Talking while driving is not safe, but you can talk and drive at the same time. When you are in the car with somebody you should just be focusing and not talking. When you in your car you should not play any loud music because you need to make sure you can hear surroundings. Like if you are in your car you might hear a police siren, but your music is too loud so you won't be able to hear the siren. Say you are in the car with your friend, and she tries to show you a fight that happened at your school, and you are driving a car you're looking at the fight not paying attention to the road, and you crash. It's your fault that you was looking at the phone and not paying attention to the road.",0
"In conclusion, nobody should use their phone while driving. It is dangerous for you to text and drive. It is also illegal for you to use your phone while driving a vehicle. Furthermore, it's always safe for you to pull over to answer a phone if it is an emergency or to text someone back. No one should text and drive because that can ruin someone's life. All you have to do is pay attention to the road, and you can be safe. Don't try to look at your phone and drive a car at the same time ",0
"Summer projects, should they be teacher-designed? Summer projects should be student-designed because, if it is teacher-designed the student may not be motivated to do it.",0
"Although Teacher-designed projects ensure that all projects are on topics that are appropriate for school, Students may not feel motivated to do a project on a topic that does not match their interests. There may be a few students that do not write on appropriate topics, but it is better than a larger amount of students not doing it simply because they have no interest in the topic.",0
"If a student writes about a topic that is not appropriate for school, it is quite easy to have that student does a new project. If a student is having a hard time finding a school appropriate topic the teacher could recommend some things that they think would be a good topic for a project. Most students won't write about things that are not school appropriate; therefore it will be less-likely that there will be a large amount of students that do not do the project.",0
"If a student is not interested in the topic that is assigned, there is nothing that they can do to change the way they feel about that topic. Having no power to change it, they will simply not do the project. If the students pick their own topics they will pick something that they are interested in. Students are more likely to do a project if it is on something that they are interested in. To ensure that the student is interested in the topic it is easier to let them pick their own topic rather than come up with several topics and let them choose.",0
"School systems would benefit from letting students pick their own topics. Not only will more students turn in their projects, they will also have fun doing them. Teacher-designed projects may not motivate students to do them which is why it is better if summer projects are student-designed. The guarantee of appropriate topics would be nice, but the likelihood of the students turning their projects in is higher if the students pick their own topics.  ",0
"The Electoral College, the real group of electors, is a process in which the public selected the electors. These electors then cast there votes for the President and Vice President. In total there are 538 electors that participate in the process and a majority of 270 votes as necessary to elect the President and the Vice President. These electors are chosen from each state, one for each member in the House of Representatives plus two for you Senators. For the District of Columbia, since it's not a real state, it is awarded three electors due to the 23rd Amendment of the Constitution. The time to vote for electors is every four years on the Tuesday after the first Monday. Some people disagree with this system, but the founding fathers of the U.S. had a reason for creating the Electoral College.",0
"During a campaign a candidate might have a lot of appeal in one area. For example a candidate might HAE a lot of appeal in the north where there is barely any state that has more than eight electoral votes and confirm that the votes will go him. Those states with very low electoral vote count will not be enough to hit 270 total votes. This drives the candidate to spread his campaign to other locations to get more votes, not only for that but because he has no reason to stay in those confirmed states. So this makes everyone across the nation feel that there votes do count.",0
The opinion that goes against the Electoral System claims that the system isn't democratic and doesn't let the people directly vote for their candidate. Or another claim is that the people don't know who the electors are or what there intentions are.,0
"It is true that it's not Democratic or that the electors are not well known. But the electors that the people vote for are usually picked out by the candidate or the candidates party, which are the people that you vote for. And by the time you got to vote for the electors they already are confirmed of who they are going to vote for so that gives no reason to doubt it.",0
"In the article ""Driverless Cars Are Coming,"" the driverless cars are not too far from our imagination and dreams. These cars could help us be safer on the road going to work, driving to school, or driving far distances. These smart cars could help us to not be Charles drivers and can help the number of crashes each year go down.",0
"The driverless cars have a long way to go. The cars shoulder't be controlled only 90 percent of the time, and the other 10 percent by human. It would be more dangerous if it was only controlled a tinny percent by man and the rest by semi-autonomous cars. What if the driver gets bored and tired, then he falls asleep and the car needed him to take over? This is why we need a 100 percent driverless car. It would be safer.",0
"Driverless cars would really come in handy with high schoolers just starting to learn to drive. High schoolers are very carless drivers, and care more about showing off or trying to have fun then they do about their own safety and everyone else's safety. With these smart cars, new drivers can be more safe. They couldn't be able to show off or maybe even try to go over the speed limited. These smart cars could also be useful with drunk drivers coming home from a party. Driverless cars have a long way to go, but they can really help us to be suffer and could help crime go down.",0
"I think that schools should not allow parents to monitor their children's grades and attendance online. First, it's like, invasion of privacy. Like, we're in school to learn and stuff, not to have our parents breathing down our necks all the time. It's stressful enough already, you know?",1
"And also, like, parents are not supposed to be the ones teaching us. That's the job of the teachers. If they're always checking up on us, it's like they don't trust the teachers to do their job. It's like, hello, we're in school to learn, not to be babysat.",1

We'll be worried about, like, what our parents will think if we don't do well on a test or something. It's like, we should be able to focus on learning, not on trying to impress our parents.",1
"But, like, on the other hand, I guess it could be good for parents to know how their kids are doing in school. Like, if a kid is struggling, the parents can help them out and stuff. But, like, they could just, like, ask the teacher for an update or something. They don't need to be online every five minutes, checking up on us. That's just, like, too much.",1

Staying Busy: The Key to Personal Success,1
"As an 8th grader, I've learned that staying busy is crucial for personal success. When we're constantly engaged in activities, whether it's schoolwork, extracurriculars, or personal projects, we're more likely to achieve our goals and reach our full potential. In this essay, I'll explore the advantages of staying busy and the dangers of being idle, and how actively pursuing our goals can lead to positive results.",1
"Firstly, staying busy helps us develop time management skills. When we have a lot on our plates, we learn how to prioritize tasks, set deadlines, and balance different responsibilities. These skills are essential for success in any area of life, whether it's academics, career, or personal relationships. By learning how to manage our time effectively, we can avoid procrastination and make the most of our time, leading to better grades, more productive work, and stronger relationships.",1
"Secondly, staying busy keeps us motivated and focused. When we're constantly working towards a goal, whether it's a project, a test, or a personal challenge, we stay motivated and engaged. We're more likely to push ourselves to work harder and achieve more, which can lead to a sense of accomplishment and self-confidence. On the other hand, when we're idle and not challenging ourselves, we can easily fall into a rut of complacency and apathy, which can lead to a lack of motivation and a sense of purposelessness.",1
"Thirdly, staying busy can help us develop new skills and interests. When we're constantly learning and trying new things, we can discover hidden talents and passions, and develop new skills that can benefit us in the long run. For example, joining a sports team or club can help us develop teamwork and leadership skills, while volunteering can help us develop empathy and compassion. By staying busy and exploring new activities, we can broaden our horizons and discover new areas of interest that can lead to a more fulfilling life.",1
"However, there are also dangers of being idle. When we're not challenging ourselves or staying engaged, we",1
"Sure, here's my attempt at writing an essay on the topic of identifying a career before high school, as an average 8th grade student:",1
"Hey, guys! Today we're gonna talk about something that's really important for our future, and that's choosing a career. Some people think it's a good idea to figure out what you want to be when you grow up before high school, while others think it's better to wait and see what interests you. So, I'm going to share some reasons for and against identifying a career before high school.",1
"First, let's talk about the pros of identifying a career before high school. One reason is that it can help you focus on your studies. If you know what you want to be when you grow up, you can start working towards it and take classes that will help you get there. For example, if you want to be a doctor, you can take science and math classes to prepare yourself. This can help you stay motivated and make the most of your time in school.",1
"Another pro is that it can give you a sense of direction. When you know what you want to do, you can start making plans and setting goals for yourself. This can help you feel more confident and in control of your future. Plus, it can be really cool to tell your friends and family what you want to be when you grow up, and they can support you in your goals.",1
"Now, let's talk about the cons of identifying a career before high school. One con is that it can be really hard to change your mind. If you decide you want to be a doctor, but then you realize you don't like blood, it can be hard to switch to something else. So, it's important to keep an open mind and not get too attached to one idea.",1
"Another con is that it can put too much pressure on you. If you know what you want to be when you grow up, you might feel like you have to work really hard to make it happen. This can be stressful and can make you feel like you're not good enough if you don't get into the right college or get the right job.",1
"In my opinion, I think it's better to wait and see what interests you before choosing a career. That",1
"This article was stating that Venus is Earth's ""twin."" It is the closest in distance as well. Venus has many things wrong with it before anyone could ever live on it. Venus could be our nearest option for planetary visit. There is Earth like qualities but, it is very dangerous. Scientist still study this world because they know that if they could have a landing that was successful then they could final really start to explore the surface.",0
"Venus is the closest planet to Earth. At times, we may be closer to Mars do to the speed at with the planets spin, but we are usually closest to Venus. Many spacecraft have been sent to Venus trying to learn more of it but each time that it has been attempted, it has only been able to last a few hours before failing. Venus is a challenging planet to be studied.",0
"Venus has many issues, but there is prove that there may have once, long ago, been covered with oceans and had plenty of adaptable life on it. Today there are still some places on Venus that have Earth like features. Land forms that look the way Earth's do. There are valleys, mountains, and traders.",0
Though it is true that Venus is closest to us and may be the best option for visitation one day in the future it still has many problems. The planets surface area is an average of 800 degrees Fahrenheit. The atomic pressure is 90 times as much as Earth. At this point in time Venus is habitat. There must be more research allowed on Venus to find out if anyone could ever step foot on it.,0
"Venus must be researched more to learn as much as possible if it is said that it is the most livable planet. It has many dangers, yes, but that is to vary reason it needs more attention. The more time spent on researching Venus the more likely that we will be able to maybe reverse the effect to make it look as it did those any a year ago when it had bodies of water and valleys.",0
"Dear Senator,",1
"I am writing to express my view that the United States should change from the Electoral College system to electing the president by a popular vote of the American people. While the Electoral College was established by the founders with the aim of having each state be represented, I believe the popular vote better reflects the will of the citizens.",1
"One argument often made in favor of keeping the Electoral College is that it encourages candidates to build broader coalitions and campaign in more states. However, research shows that candidates tend to focus their efforts only on swing states that could vote either way. This means that the vast majority of states receive little attention, and their citizens feel ignored. A popular vote system would encourage candidates to appeal to voters across the entire nation, not just selective swing states. It would make every vote truly equal and give voice to more Americans. ",1
"It is also argued that without the Electoral College, small states would be neglected. Yet a popular vote does not diminish any state's role. Candidates would still try to earn support from voters in all 50 states. Some may express concern that large, population-heavy states would dominate national elections, but candidates would still need to form a majority coalition including many other states to win. A national popular vote does not advantage large states alone.",1
"Most importantly, the popular vote aligns with the fundamental principle that in a democracy, the winner should be who receives the most individual votes nationally. While the Electoral College process usually results in the candidate who earned the most votes winning, it is possible for the candidate with fewer national votes to take office. This undermines the idea of one person, one vote. In an era where we have grown accustomed to seeing vote tallies nationally, the Electoral College system can seem unnecessarily complex and indirect. ",1
"For these reasons, I believe changing to a national popular vote would strengthen our democracy and ensure that every American's ballot carries the same weight in selecting their president. The will of the national majority should be what determines the outcome each election. I encourage you to support electoral reform to implement this fairer system.",1

"Was life better when we didn't have cars? There are many advantages to giving up our little privilege to ride around; If we as a community were to give up having cars we would have less pollution, reduce greenhouse gas emission and our communities would improve rapidly. We need to give up cars to form a better more safe environment for our families.",0
"First off, an advantage to limiting car usage would be less pollution in our areas. ""Cold nights and warms days caused the warmer layer of air to trap car emission""(Duffer 15). ""In source 2 ""Paris bans driving due to smog"" it also shows that because of the enormous amount of smog from cars they had to ban driving. After just 5 days of no car usage, the amount of pollution was down 60 percent. We as a people have to realize how drastic that change is. All we have to do to help the environment and nature grow more efficiently is to not use our cars as often.",0
"Another advantage to lessening our use in automobiles is the reduction of green house gas emission. ""... Passenger cars are responsible for 12 percent of greenhouse gas emissions in Europe...""(Rosenthal 5). There our many programs and agencies trying to reduce greenhouse affects; such as the one above, by banning the use of cars; one being the Environmental Protection Agency. President Obama is also trying to curb the United States greenhouse gas emissions as shown in source 4 ""the End of Car Culture."" David Goldberg, an official of the Transportation of America says ""All of our development since World War 11 has been centered on the car...""(Rosenthal 7). We as a people are so indulged with cars and how efficient they may be in some aspects we don't realize the harm its doing to our communities.",0
"Lastly an advantage to the limitations of car usage, is our communities improving rapidly. An example of this is The day without cars improvement campaign in Colombia, shown in source 3. During this day people that lived in those areas would have to ride a bike, hike, take a bus or walk to work or school. Because of this there were no traffic jams and parks and sports centers bloomed. Also, because so many were involved in this, the sidewalks and streets were improved and new restaurants and shopping centers were developing.",0
"In all, The effects of limiting car usage would cause less pollution, lesson the amount of greenhouse gas emission and cause our communities to improve rapidly. Fellow citizens we could change the way we live for the better. Limiting the use of cars would have a drastic change and help our communities blossom.",0
"Distance learning is a form of learning that allows students to learn outside the classroom setting through video conferences and online courses. This form of learning allows students to learn in any environment they want, whether that be their home, a library, or any other setting they feel most comfortable in. Although this may seem like a good option for students to opt for, students would not benefit more than opposed to learning from an actual classroom setting in a school building, especially when thinking about the resources and skills that schools can teach and offer.",0
"One of the many reasons why schools exist is to provide a social setting that students are able to immerse themselves in. Schools provide a setting in which students are able to socialize with other students, creating a group or community for themselves as they form friends with the students they attend these classes with. This is not provided online; take home-schoolers, for example. Many home-schoolers report feeling socially isolated from people of their age group as a result of not having the social setting to thrive and form friendships in. These home-schoolers are not given the opportunity to create bonds with students because their classes are primarily online; it is because of their isolation that many home-schoolers find difficultly forming friendships with others. Online schooling and video conferencing takes away that social aspect of school, and can thus result in students who are unable to socialize with other people when it comes to the real world. However, there are people with certain anxiety disorders who would appreciate being able to learn from the comfort of their own home. But, immersing them in an environment that encourages social interaction would be a more ideal situation as they would be able to learn how to overcome their anxiety; there are more effective, and less drastic measures that can be taken to help a student with social anxiety as opposed to taking them out of the classroom setting altogether and replacing them with online settings.",0
"Not only do schools and classroom settings provide the ability for one to form relationships and learn how to interact with other students and adults, they also instill the necessary cooperative skills that students need in the real world once they have completed their school career and move onto the next step of their adulthood. For example, schools have their students build collaboration skills through group projects; online schooling or video conferencing does not provide this same benefit of collaboration. When a student is working from the comfort of their own home, they are not actively collaborating with other students; it is essential for students to have the ability to cooperate with other people in the real world. These group projects add the benefit of teaching students how to work with others in order to get certain tasks done, preparing them for when they have to inevitably work with other people they may not necessarily like. Online schooling is largely independent, and requires the student to rely on themselves and only themselves, while classroom settings teach both independence and dependence. Students must learn how to work with other people so that they can learn how to deal with individuals who are difficult to cooperate with, and so that they learn to rely on others when in need of assistance.",0
"Not only do online classrooms lack certain aspects necessary for a student to survival in the real world, but they also lack the accessibility of help when a student needs it. In a classroom setting, students are able to ask for help from their peers and teachers so that they can better understand the topic they are learning about. Online settings do not have this help accessible to their students all the time. Video conferencing may provide that needed assistance should a student need it, but students may feel uncomfortable asking for help as video conferences are typically done in masses; students who are all taking the course from home would be on the video call, and asking questions would require teachers to stop their lesson to re-explain a concept to everyone because one individual asked for help. In addition, video conferencing settings lacks the ability for that students to bond with the teacher, unlike classroom settings, which can increase their feelings of discomfort towards asking for help. An example of this lack of accessible help can be seen through London vision, an online system which allows students to take their classes from home and online. Many students who take courses through vision feel an overwhelming anxiety about taking the class because they do not have a teacher accessible to them; they are expected to complete overwhelming amounts of work without the help of a physical teacher nearby. As a result, many students procrastinate doing the work, and are thus left with more anxiety about the class in general. Students who take vision courses complain about their teachers, who have a tendency to fail them as a result of doing an assignment wrong because they did not understand it. It is because of these scenarios that physical classroom setting are more beneficial than online or video conferences, as they have the necessary resources for students to be able to ask for help.",0
"When comparing distance learning and in-class learning, it is evident that students would benefit much more from being in a classroom setting than from learning in the comfort of their own homes. Not only do online classes and video conferences lack the ability for students to gain any sort of social skills, but they also lack the ability to teach students how to cooperate with one another, which is an important skill that students must acquire to survive the real world. In addition, in-class learning allows for students to ask for help when needed. It is because of this that students would not benefit from attending classes at home.",0
"I think that using the technology to read student emotional expression of student in a class is valuable because it helps to see if a student is happy/mad/sad. Like in the passage it's talking about how they are using this new technology call ''The Facial Action coding system ''Which mean -a system enables computers to identify human emotions. They are also using the 3-D computer model of the face, As they can also calculate the emotions. As because you can see what is wrong with your friend/family.",0
"One reason why I think it's valuable for technology to read your emotional expression on students is by the program ''Facial Action Coding System'' why because just by using a video as it sates in the passage 4 ''using video imagery the new emotion recognition software tracks these facial movements ''they can see what kind of emotion you have and for them to help you out I am guessing or at less it can be value for making them feel better.Also, because is the system is what emotions that person has it can let other people know and just to keep an eye on them. I feel like it will work on other person as well it will help me out because sometimes my mom/dead get a serious face and I don't know if they are happy or sad.",0
It also can be valuable for student's in school because in that way you can help them out to feel better or sometimes you just don't know when that person is feeling happy or sad as it states in the passage 5 ''You can probably tell how a friend is feeling simply by the look on her/his face '' and the new technology can help you read their emotions the way they are feeling. Another reason why it can help on students with the new technology by to imagine as it states in passage 6 and just by to imagine the computer will know when you are happy or sad. This can help us by helping them out and for them not to feel that way because sometimes when student's get mad they do thing they know shouldn't do but all that sadness or anger can take them over by causing harm. As it will be nice to stop the harm from someone doing it. Another example is this Wed ad as stated in the passage 6 as well now this wed can see your other emotions as an example.'' If you smile when a wed ad appears on your screen a similar ad might follow. But if you frown the next ad will be different.'' A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored '' As Dr. Hangs predicts then he could modify the lesson because they want the student's to pay action in the classroom for them to learn and not make the class boring or for student to get lost and never asking question but as that to then the teacher will know what makes them get bored and what makes them get forces. This will help for many other student in school by not causing harm if they made and also by helping student not get bored or lose forces.,0
Now on my personal life I will say that the technology will help me by seeing how are people feeling when I see them walking around with their face down or just seeing them happy. Like for example lets say that I am walking around the hallway and see my friend with a serious face or just them not talking to I would like to use the technology and see what is wrong with them and try to help them out with the feeling they have and just try to change their mood. Another reason why I would like to help is by seeing how does my mom feel when she looks at me like just take a picture of her and see what are the emotion she has or as in passage say in 7 an ''encode ''different emotions like make her look at her self in the mirror and follow the steps it says and see what are the emotion she has. But yes the technology ''The Facial expression for each emotion are universal ''because it can help out in many always,0
"As you see I do valuable the technology to read the emotional expressions of student in a class because it can help in many ways to see the way they are feeling in there emotion and in there way of leading. Just like Dr. Huang He doesn't want his student to lose forces and doesn't want them to feel sad either. Just like it will help in school for the student's.Also, as using the 3-D computer mood just by seeing and imagine it can see what kind of feeling you are having. As yes, it will be valued to use later in ;life well it will help me with my friends and even my own kids and students at schools.",0
"Summer vacation is a time for students to relax from all the work and stress associated with school. Teachers assign arduous assignments and projects that requires many hours to complete. Should summer projects be teacher -designed or student -designed? Summer projects should be student designed because students will be more inclined to do the project, student projects are unique, and it is a good experience for the youth.",0
"Students will be more intrigued by projects created by their peers. Projects assigned by teachers are often dull and pointless. Having seen many projects assigned by adults, students understand the basis of a quality project idea. Peer designed projects are often more fun, as it was created by a young creative mind. Students will be more interested in taking part in student -designed projects over the summer.",0
"Student -designed projects are unique, as they have participated in numerous projects. Teachers assign multiple projects per class in a given year. Students often find teacher -designed projects to be useless and is seen as busy work. Peers understand what a creative and helpful project consists of. Summer projects should be fun and easy because students worked hard all year. Student -designed projects would be relaxed and more unique.",0
"Teacher -designed projects are often complex with multiple segments. Students look forward to a relaxing summer, as they worked very hard during the school year. School creates lots of stress and students often lose hours of sleep. Projects designed by teachers could be more beneficial to learning, but will intrude on the students time off. Stress is the last thing students need during their summer break.",0
"Summer projects designed by students will be beneficial to both the student and teacher. Designing a project is a good experience for kids to have, as it helps with creativity and leadership. Summer projects should be student designed because students will be more inclined to do the project and student projects are unique. ",0
"I don't think we need driverless cars. It just makes humans even more lazy and is probably a waste on resources as well as time. My position on driverless cars are they are not needed just the fact that no one needs to have it. In paragraph seven it states, ""The car can handle functions at speeds up to twenty-five mph, but special touch sensors make sure that driver keeps hold of the wheel. This statement basically states that the car can only go up to twenty-five mph, but you have to be holding the wheel for it to do this. So your basically just sitting there as it just goes the only thing you're not working is the gas. You would have to watch just because if you were to work between work zones or accidents.",0
"The most important thing for a driver in a car is safely. This car is posed to help that part out by using cameras to watch the driver and the road. If they were to def unction or break how would you get another one or would you be able to buy them in the store or pay for them again from the company. Also, if the technology or the car were to fail while the driver is distracted or worst and someone were to get injured, who is held in charge of it. Will the driver face the charge or the manufactures who made it?",0
"Not to mention it doing all of this stuff at once, how much gas can go for one mile. We are trying to build cars that can go farther and not have that much gas, so what will be the mileage on this car that can drive itself. Will it run off of batteries, fossil fuels or something that doesn't harm the environment.",0
"This ends my position on driverless cars on the road. I think it's not a good idea based off the fact that we came this far driving cars without them driving for us or anything like it. We can go without cars driving themselves, what we need to focus on is can we improve how far a car goes with just one gallon of gas so improving their mph. This would help people go farther without the cost of gas it would slow down the rate of resources going down and help our environment.",0
"Everyone knows that traveling outer space can be risky. Some many even say it is dangerous. Others may say that we can come up with better technology to improve safety when traveling other planets in outer space. In ""The Challenge of Exploring Venus"" the author gives their support to the idea of exploring the planet Venus.",0
"Traveling Venus would be dangerous in many ways. For one, it is the second planet closes to the sun, so it would be extremely hot. Next, the air pressure would be quite hard for humans to handle as well. In the passage it states, ""On the planet's surface, temperatures average over 800 degrees Fahrenheit, and the atmospheric pressure is 90 times greater than what we experience on our own planet."" This clearly gives enough information to say that these conditions are more extreme than what any human can handle.",0
"A way we could be able to visit Venus is if we had better technology. NASA has had quite a few ideas for sending humans to Venus. In the text it says, ""a vehicle hovering over Venus would avoid the unfriendly ground conditions by staying up and out of their way."" By using this sort of vehicle humans would be able to make the trip survivable.",0
"The author of this passage seems to be very open and supportive of the idea of studying and listing Venus. In the paragraph 8 the author claims, ""Our travels on Earth and beyond should not be limited by dangers and doubts but should be expanded to meet the very edges of imaginations and innovations."" From this authors' statement we can infer that they are on board with the idea of the travels to Venus and that we should not like dangers or doubts hold us back from being able to study this planet. Although it may be challenging we must not let that stop us.",0
"Although there may be many conflicting dangers and concerns with space travel, it is possible. As the author said, we should not let doubt stop us from discovering a great planet. We can come up with the technology to some day visit this planet. With the correct technology anything can be possible.",0
"Dear Principal, I am writing you a letter saying about changing the school policy I think that students should participate in sports and activities students should at least have a B or C average in a sport. So that what ever sport they play they can still be in it. We can see what the students think about it to see if they would what the policy change or not they probably think if they liked it change, or they don't liked it changed to have least have a B average to participate in sports or other activities. I think some students would like the change and some others students probably like about the change of the policy that might be possible to change. I have no idea what they would think about the change to the policy that might be possible to be changing when you can only participate in sports or other activities like clubs and all the other stuff. My friend of mine told me she has a C average in one class and the rest she has like a B average she thinks she does. She also told me if it does change she would say she doesn't like the policy being changed. Because she said some students won't liked it any way. She bets some would at least like the idea of changed it to have least a B average. My other friends of mine don't want it to change. I agree with them about it possible about it being changed. That's all I got to write. Sincerely, STUDENT_NAME, P.S. I think some people would like the change so that way they can get better grades, so they can also go to the next grade that way they can go to college and live their Dr",0
"I believe that social media has a significant impact on societal norms and values. Social media has the power to influence people's beliefs, behaviors, and decisions. It provides a platform for the exchange of ideas, opinions, and information that can shape the way we think and act.",1
"One example of how social media can impact societal norms and values is through the spread of misinformation. People often share false information on social media, which can lead to confusion and misunderstandings. This can result in a shift in societal norms and values, as people may base their opinions on inaccurate information.",1
"Another example is the way social media can affect body image and self-esteem. Social media platforms are filled with images of perfect-looking people, which can lead to unrealistic beauty standards and body-shaming. This can negatively impact people's mental health and contribute to a culture of perfectionism.",1
"On the other hand, social media can also be used for positive change. For example, it can be used to raise awareness of social and political issues, promote inclusivity, and connect people from diverse backgrounds. Through social media, we can learn from one another and develop a greater understanding of different cultures and perspectives.",1
"In conclusion, social media has a significant impact on societal norms and values. Its impact can be both positive and negative, depending on how it is used. Therefore, we must use social media responsibly and critically, ensuring that we consume and share accurate information and promote positive values.",1
"Cars have become an indispensable part of our lives. We use them to get to work, go to the grocery store, and visit friends and family. But there are a number of advantages to limiting car usage.",1
"First, limiting car usage can help to reduce pollution. Cars are a major source of air pollution, which can lead to health problems such as asthma, heart disease, and cancer. By reducing our reliance on cars, we can improve air quality and protect our health.",1
"Second, limiting car usage can help to conserve energy. Cars are a major source of energy consumption, and the production of cars and car parts also requires a lot of energy. By using public transportation, walking, or biking instead of driving, we can reduce our energy consumption and help to protect the environment.",1
"Third, limiting car usage can help to improve our physical health. Walking and biking are great ways to get exercise, and they can help us to maintain a healthy weight. By reducing our time spent driving, we can make more time for physical activity and improve our overall health.",1
"Fourth, limiting car usage can help to save money. Cars are expensive to buy, maintain, and insure. By driving less, we can save money on gas, parking, and other expenses.",1
"Fifth, limiting car usage can help us to connect with our communities. When we walk or bike instead of drive, we are more likely to walk past our neighbors and interact with them. This can help to build a stronger sense of community.",1
"In conclusion, there are a number of advantages to limiting car usage. By reducing our reliance on cars, we can improve air quality, conserve energy, improve our physical health, save money, and connect with our communities.",1
"As an average 8th grade student, I believe that following one's instincts and ideas is crucial when making decisions in life. It's easy to get caught up in what others think or what we think we should do, but sometimes, our instincts can guide us to the best possible outcome. When we don't follow our instincts, we might end up in a situation that doesn't feel right or that we don't enjoy.",1
"For example, I once had to choose between joining the school soccer team or the drama club. I had always loved playing soccer, but something just didn't feel right about it this time around. I went with my gut and joined the drama club instead, and it ended up being one of the best decisions I ever made. Furthermore, I discovered a new passion and made some amazing friends. If I had listened to my parents and coaches and joined the soccer team, I might have missed out on that opportunity.",1
"Another time, I was thinking about what college I wanted to attend. My parents wanted me to go to a prestigious university, but I had my heart set on a smaller college with a better art program. I knew that I wanted to study art, but my parents were worried that I wouldn't be able to get a good job with a degree from a smaller school. In the end, I decided to follow my instincts and attend the college of my choice. It was the best decision I ever made, as I ended up getting an amazing education and making lifelong friends.",1
"Self-reliance is a crucial life skill because it allows us to make decisions for ourselves and to trust our own instincts. When we rely on ourselves, we can make decisions that are best for us, rather than what others think is best for us. This can help us to be more confident and independent, and to make decisions that align with our values and goals.",1
"However, it's important to note that seeking guidance from experts can also be beneficial. Sometimes, we might not have all the information or experience to make the best decision on our own. In those cases, it's okay to ask for help from people who have more knowledge or experience. For example, if I were trying to decide on a career path, I might seek advice from a career counselor or",1
"Many schools around the country design and assign summer projects for students to complete over the summer break. This is help students continue to learn and keep their brains active during summer break. Summer assignments also help students prepare for their incoming classes by learning concepts before the year starts. To better benefit the student, summer assignments should be teacher-designed because teachers have more knowledge of the course curriculum and many students need a teacher who can lead them through new concepts of the class.",0
"Summer assignments are designed to help students maintain an active mind and prepare for their upcoming classes by learning course concepts before the school year starts. Teachers are trained for years to master the subject they are going to teach and mostly likely have already seen or learned the material in the class they are going teaching. Students do not know the course curriculum before they have taken the class. If the summer assignment was designed by the students, the assignment would not be as beneficially because students do not know what the curriculum of the class is.",0
"For example, in classes I have always been give assignments created by my teachers. But, one class my teacher gave us an open-ended project where students could create their own project using our ideas. All the kids in my class took weeks and even months to find an idea for their project. The students in my class had no idea what the teacher was looking for and how to correlate their ideas into the class curriculum. However, a teacher already knows the curriculum. This will allow for a more efficient and beneficial way of learning for the student because the teacher can create assignments they know is related to the course.",0
"Not only do student not know the course concepts, students also do not have the skills to create assignments; students need a teacher leader to guide them through the new class. When learning a new concept, students can become overwhelmed if they do not understand the topics. At my school, some classes have very little guidance from teachers to help the students understand a new topic. My friends in these classes become very overwhelmed and become more apathetic to the class. Students do not understand how to learn a new without the guidance of a teacher. A teachers job is to create assignments, tests, and projects to lead their students towards mastering a concept. When teachers create assignments they are more involved with guiding their students. If summer assignments were student-designed there would be a lack of guidance compared to an assignment made from a teacher would have. This would cause students to inefficiently learn through summer assignments.",0
"People who support student-designed summer assignments may argue that advanced placement (AP) classes require students to learn from textbooks without the guidance of a teacher, so students do not need teacher guidance. But when taking a look at the students in these AP classes, on average students in AP classes struggle and receive poor grades in these classes. This is due to the lack of teacher leadership in these classes. Students in AP classes do not get enough guidance to fully understand the curriculum.",0
Summer assignments should be teacher-designed because teachers have more knowledge on the course curriculum and students need teacher guidance while learning new concepts. Summer assignments would be more effective if the teachers created the assignments themselves. Summer assignments that effectively teach students the curriculum over summer break will help benefit the students during the school year.,0
"I highly think students should design, and the reason why I'm closing students is because, students need the opportunity to express what they feel plus, student are way more creative in my opinion. Some teachers think that the students shouldn't make their own prompts because I guess the teachers want the prompts to have reasons to them.",0
"First, these props do sometimes get on my nerves in my opinion because were spending our time trying to figure out how OT set up the thesis and what examples can will fit with the paragraph and how does it support the idea. When the teachers make these prompts they expect us to get it right off the back and not struggle but some of them we have to sit back and think about how can this be an impact of how does this support the idea. Us students can be very excellent writers if we try and take our time, that's why if we get to write our own prompts about creative things and events that we've experienced.",0
"Secondly, The reason why that I say that the teachers shouldn't write the paragraphs is because half of them are about school activities, there'ye never about fun things we don't on the weekends or how our breaks were there'ye always about adding extra hours in school, dress codes and adding extra class or something like that its near on things the students want to write about it always has to be school related near something fun.",0
"Lastly, Some students may say that the teachers write better prompts but when you writes bout something you actually enjoy or love then you actually might consider because writing is another way of expressing how you feel, and it gives you different ways to say it. Writing is and important thing in life because when we go off to college it's going to get harder because were in the stage of becoming and adult grow up and college is no joke its way harder it's preparing you for the outside world (life) so enjoy writing while you can because it dent get any easier than this",0
"In conclusion, I feel as if the students would write better prompts then the teachers in my opinion. We the students have more creativity than the teachers no offense but I'm just speaking the truth, us students can make writing prompts and other activities way more fun than it already is. What I'm trying to say is give us students a chance to write some prompts and make writing more fun and educational.",0
"What is the electoral college?  The electoral college is a process which consists of the selection of the electors, meeting where they vote for president, and the counting of the votes.  The real question is, is the electoral college helping us or is it just bringing our government farther towards disaster? The electoral college should be diminished because it is an unfair direct election, and the disaster factor.",0
"To begin, by keeping the electoral college we could avoid run off elections.  This would help our governmental system because as noted by Richard A. Poster, ""There is pressure for run-off elections when no candidate wins a majority of the votes cast.""  By keeping the electoral college, we could help resolve run-off elections.  What we don't know is if it will permanently work for our governmental system and is it worth the risk? The electors are the ones voting for the president, so we should question whether they should have control to help avoid these run-off elections.  The writer notes, ""... the pressure would greatly complicate the presidential election process, is reduced by electoral college..."" (Poster).  Although that is true, that is only one problem that would be resolved by the electoral college, and one benefit is outnumbered by the numerous disadvantages to the electoral college.",0
"Moreover, the disaster factor has a huge impact on the electoral collage.  The writer states, ""The American people should consider themselves lucky that the 2000 fiasco was the biggest election crisis in a century; the system allows for much worse"" (Plume).  This disaster was not the first disaster to happen in the system.  According to Plume, the system has had much more effect and damage on the United States and this should not be repeated.  The writer also says, ""electors have occasionally refused to vote for their party's candidate and cast a deciding vote for whomever they please"" (Plume).  This goes to show, not only is the electoral college beneficial, but they can be sneaky.  The electoral college should be abolished because of the atrocious outcomes it is capable of doing to our government.",0
"Not only is the electoral college capable of the disaster factor, but it also has no direct election.  As stated in ""What Is the Electoral College?"", ""... when you vote for your candidate you are actually voting for your candidate's electors."" (Office of the Federal Register).  This means, voters have no control over whom controls the country.  That is outrageous that the lives of these people will be affected by someone they did not want in the overpowering decisions of their country. Writer Plume states, ""At the most basic level, the electoral college is unfair too voters"" as well as ""The electoral college is unfair, outdated, and irrational"" (Plume).  Both of these point go to show that the electoral college is lowering our hopes for the government.  The writer also notes, ""candidates don't spend time in states they have no chance in winning, focusing only on the tight races in the ""swing"" states"" (Plume).  This proves that the electoral government thinks about their winning chances instead of our countries' government.  Are we going to sit here and let them take advantage of their power that will lead us towards disaster?",0
"All in all, the electoral collage should be banished from the government.  Who wants our government to get weaker and more unfair to the citizens?  By taking away the electoral college our government would gain back its strength and become the hard-working government we know it can be!  ",0
"Seeking multiple opinions when making an important choice or decision is beneficial for a few key reasons. First, getting different perspectives allows you to consider aspects of the choice you may not have thought of on your own. Different people will have had different experiences that shape their views, so hearing more than one side can help highlight both pros and cons you may have overlooked. ",1
"Secondly, conflicting opinions force you to really examine your own feelings and rationale more closely. When people disagree on a choice, you have to think critically about why each perspective makes its case. This self-reflection helps ensure the factors most important to you personally are prioritized in your final decision. You can weigh opinions against your own values and priorities.",1
A third reason multiple opinions are valuable is that no one person has all the answers. Even well-meaning friends and family see things only from their own point of view. Collecting several perspectives increases the chances of getting guidance that aligns with reality. One advisor might miss something another could catch. The convergence of consistent advice from different sources builds confidence that the consensus view has merit. ,1
"Finally, taking time to consider multiple opinions shows good decision-making. It demonstrates you are a thoughtful, careful person who does not make important choices lightly. Consulting others is more mature than acting hastily on an initial gut reaction. The process of comparing varied viewpoints also gives you stronger justification for your ultimate decision if questions arise later. Weighing a diversity of advice helps ensure the choice you make is well-informed and in your best long-term interests.",1
"In conclusion, seeking multiple perspectives provides distinct advantages over relying on a single opinion when facing significant decisions. Hearing from more than one trusted advisor leads to choices that have been scrutinized from numerous angles and therefore have a greater chance of being the right one for your own unique circumstances and priorities. Multiple inputs result in wiser, more well-reasoned selections.",1
"As the saying goes, ""It takes a village to raise a child."" Indeed, children's education is not just the responsibility of teachers, but also of parents. In my opinion, all parents should be required to volunteer time to their children's schools. This essay will explain my position with specific reasons and examples.",1
"Firstly, volunteering at school can help parents better understand their children's education. Many parents may be unfamiliar with the school's curriculum or teaching methods. By volunteering, they can observe how their children learn and interact with classmates and teachers. This experience can give them insights into their children's strengths and weaknesses, as well as their interests and needs. For example, a parent who volunteers at a reading group may notice that their child struggles with phonics or that they have a passion for science. Armed with this knowledge, parents can better support their children's learning at home and communicate effectively with teachers.",1
"Secondly, volunteering can foster a sense of community and connection between parents, teachers, and students. When parents are involved in school activities, they can meet other parents and form friendships. These relationships can help parents feel more connected to their children's school and more invested in their education. Moreover, parents who volunteer can serve as role models for their children. They show that education is important and that everyone has a responsibility to contribute to the community. For instance, a parent who volunteers as a soccer coach can inspire their child to be a team player and to value physical activity.",1
"Thirdly, volunteering can be an opportunity for parents to use their skills and talents to benefit the school. Parents have a wide range of talents and expertise, such as cooking, gardening, or graphic design. By volunteering, they can share their skills and enrich the school's programs. For example, a parent who is a chef can organize a healthy cooking workshop for students, while a parent who is an artist can create murals or posters to decorate the school. This kind of contribution can make a big difference in the school's atmosphere and can inspire students to pursue their own interests and talents.",1
"Of course, some people may argue that requiring parents to volunteer is an infringement of their freedom and privacy. They may argue that parents have busy lives and should not be compelled to spend extra time at school. However, I believe that volunteering should be seen as a civic duty, not a burden. Education is a public good that benefits all members of society, and parents have a special responsibility to ensure that their children receive the best education possible. Moreover, volunteering can be flexible and can take many forms, such as attending a parent-teacher conference, chaperoning a field trip, or making a donation to the school. There are many ways to contribute, and parents can choose the ones that suit their schedules and preferences.",1
"In conclusion, all parents should be required to volunteer time to their children's schools. Volunteering can help parents understand their children's education, build community, and use their skills to benefit the school. It can also show children the value of education and civic engagement. As a society, we should recognize the importance of education and the role of parents in supporting it. By working together, we can create a better future for our children and for ourselves.",1
Student Summer Projects,0
"During the summer we all have received some sort of project or assignment that would be due during the first week of school. However, the projects are always assigned by teachers on what they think that is best for us. Not all students are pleased with the fact that we have to do work during the break. Considering that they just went to school for almost ten months and still have teachers think about what the students should do during summer break it's not fair. In my opinion I think that teachers should let students choose their own summer projects because they can have fun while making the project, turn the project however they like into something creative and have them be motivated. Summer is the time to not stress about assignments that are complicated. Instead, it should have the student be interesting to have something to do so they can remember the memories they made while making the project.",0
"Summer is the time when students can be stress-free and just have fun with friends and family. Including the fun activities they enjoy doing. That should be the main idea of a summer project because letting students decide how they want to do their own projects will keep them motivated on doing it because they can express their creative minds onto something they know they won't get judged on. For example, Most people even without having to do a school project, the majority of teenagers want to document their summer to show everybody what they did, to remember the amazing sunsets or sunrises throughout summer or the cool places they went too and family events that happened. As well with trying new thing that you didn't think you would enjoy but by the help of the summer project you made, you learned a lot more about yourself. Either by the help of a friend or by just finding new activities that interested you by reading it or by seeing a commercial. Students want to share every detail of it because it was something they experienced during those two months that made them happy and not feel overwhelmed with stress that was over their heads because of a boring assignment their previous teacher assigned them before school ended.",0
"In addition, while students are making the project they can work individually. Some may feel more motivated to think outside the box on what your whole topic should be or how they can make it happen. However, with a group project you can work with friends make it even more adventurous. Some students may think differently instead of going out they can make an invention or make something from scratch, the possibilities are endless because it would be up to the student to create something unique that teachers may not have thought of before.",0
"When teachers design projects sometimes it isn't the type of projects that we all expect. You can't really be creative because the majority of the time they will give you a template of the important things you should actually do, and it just gets rid of the fun of doing the project because you're only doing what it is asking you to do. As well with having teachers design the project it wouldn't make much sense because you passed all your classes as well with the grade you just passed. During the summer you don't have any teachers that you're enrolled in yet in their class. That's the main reason why I think it shouldn't be up to the teachers to design and have the students instead.",0
"In conclusion, I strongly think that summer projects should be student-designed rather than having teachers designed the project because summer is the time when even if you're a teacher student, principle. It is your summer and your own experience. You should at least as a student have the control of what your own summer project should be about during your summer break because it is where you mostly spend time with family and friends just enjoy everybody's time. Also, it helps you think in many ways on how you can make your summer the best one yet by doing many activities or starting new hobbies just because of this project and learn yourself at most by just having fun. A project doesn't have to be boring, you just have to find what interests you and what helps you keep motivated.",0

There are many benefits to teaching children to cooperate. One of the most important is that it helps children learn how to get along with others. This is important because it will help them in their personal lives and in their careers.,1
Another benefit of teaching children to cooperate is that it helps them learn how to work together. This is important because it will help them in their professional lives. They will be able to work together to achieve a common goal.,1
"Finally, teaching children to cooperate helps them learn how to compromise. This is important because it will help them in their personal relationships. They will be able to find a middle ground that everyone can agree on.",1
"Dear Principal,",0
"I am a student of your school, and I am against the rules of the grade requirement.",0
"Most of the students in the school have a C grade average, so it takes away from them, and C is passing, so I believe they should be allowed to participate still as long as they have a C average.",0
"Many kids are very good at sports and activities and all of them aren't always smart, and they might not be able to live life out how they could be so successful. School is a big part of life, but it is not always everything, grades should not be centered around sports, I believe. Pro athletes do not have to have a B average, so why would kids have to do school things to be able to do sports?",0
"Some kids with disabilities, they might be really good at sports or other activities after school, and they might not get the B average, are we going say no to people that can really be successful in life at those skills, just because they didn't have the best grades in school? That would be ruining a kid's life, as he grows up, and he could have really been something in those activities, but his grade messed him up, and maybe he really tried his best.",0
"I think we should change the rule, and give people the right to do the activities. Grades are supposed to be up, but not everyone is smart enough, and they try, but maybe they just can't get it. So I believe that the grade requirement should not be that high, or have one at all.",0

"Studying abroad is an excellent opportunity for college students to gain real-world experiences in a foreign culture. It allows students to develop language proficiency, increase their knowledge of the world, and become more independent. Therefore, I believe that colleges and universities should require their students to spend at least one semester studying in a foreign country.",1
"First, studying abroad is an effective way to learn a language. Students are forced to use their language skills in everyday interactions with locals, which encourages local speech patterns and slang. Additionally, many universities offer study abroad programs specifically aimed at language learning. For example, the American University in Paris offers an immersion program in which students attend French classes and participate in cultural activities, such as field trips and excursions. By putting themselves in an environment where they are immersed in the language, students are able to make more rapid progress in their language skills.",1
"Second, studying abroad provides an opportunity to deepen one’s knowledge of the world. When living in a foreign country, students are exposed to the culture, customs, and values that are unique to that place. For example, a student spending a semester in Japan may learn about the importance of respect in Japanese culture and how it affects the way people interact with each other. This knowledge helps to create a more holistic understanding of the world, which is invaluable for college students.",1
"Lastly, studying abroad encourages independence and self-reliance. When living away from home and in a foreign country, students must learn to take care of themselves. This includes tasks such as navigating public transportation, finding housing, and shopping for groceries. Additionally, since students are in a new place where they don’t necessarily know the language, they must learn to make decisions on their own and handle problems as they arise. All of these skills are invaluable life lessons that students can carry with them throughout their lives.",1
"In conclusion, I believe that colleges and universities should require their students to spend at least one semester studying in a foreign country. Not only will this provide an opportunity to learn a language, deepen one’s knowledge of the world, and become more independent, but it is also an invaluable experience that will shape and enrich the lives of students.",1
"Hi I am Luke, and I am a Seagoing Cowboy. A SeagoingCowboy is someone that sails on a boat and the boat has farm animals that you take care of. I have been a SeagoingCowboy for nine years, and I am still fascinated at all the places we go to. I have been to the Acropolis in Greece, I also rode a Gondola in Venice, Italy, a city with streets of water.",0
"Would you like to be a SeagoingCowboy it's a lot of fun and I forgot to tell you also get to feed the farm animals. It's a very long sail, but it's worth the sightseeing. The night watch is like a job you have to check on the animals every hour to make sure their okay. But the night watch could be scary one time I fell and cracked my ribs.",0
"There are also some fun things you can do on the ship once you drop of the animals. When you're returning from dropping of the animals you can play baseball and volleyball games in the empty holds where animals had been housed. Ping-Pong's tournaments, fencing, boxing, reading, whittling, and other games that helped pass time on the boat.",0
"The animals on the ship were pigs, sheep, chickens, cows, roosters, horses, and goats. The most liked animal was the horses because they were nice, and the fur was very soft. Every time at night you could hear the animals for a little then they would final settle down.",0
"Would you like to be a SeagoingCowboy if not that's okay, but it's very fun? Being a SeagoingCowboy keeps you active, and it helps you learn responsibility and being trustworthy. There are signups next year in New Orleans, Louisiana. This is Luke we will see you in New Orleans next year.",0
"There are good benefits and bad benefits of not having a car. With your legs being your transportation to get around the city, allows you to get a new experience of getting around. But it can also be pretty nerve wrecking knowing you have to walk everywhere you want to go. But the more walking you do, the less money you're spending. Having no worries about paying for gas, car notes, tickets, etc.",0
"Another good thing about not having a car is staying in shape. Walking around to get to where you need to go would get you more than plenty excerise. Nothing like having a nice healthy body, burning calories, and even pounds. Having nice strong and healthy heart and burning off the fat that you put on by doing nothing and being physically active by walking.",0
"Fewer accidents, car jams, traffic problems, and even car solution. What parent doesn't want a cleaner air for there children to breathe? Fewer cars can somehow lead to a safer environment. Less car accidents dealing with people texting and driving, which could lead to less possibilities of death, maybe.",0
"No one wants to walk everywhere their trying to go, nothing wrong with going for a nice bike ride there. Limiting car usage can maybe differ the world, cause less problems, fewer worries, and the best of all. . . SAVE MORE MONEY!  ",0
"Dear Senator,",1
"I am writing to you today to argue that the United States should change from the current Electoral College system to electing the president by nationwide popular vote. While the Electoral College has its intentions of giving voice to smaller states, I believe the popular vote would better represent the will of all American citizens.",1
"One argument in favor of keeping the Electoral College is that it encourages candidates to build broader coalitions and campaign across many states. However, research shows that candidates largely focus their efforts on only a handful of swing states that could vote either way. This means that many states are ignored during campaigns. Switching to the popular vote would motivate candidates to campaign everywhere and develop policies that appeal to a wide variety of Americans from different backgrounds. ",1
"It is also argued that the Electoral College protects the influence of smaller states. However, in recent elections we have seen candidates win the Electoral College despite losing the nationwide popular vote. This undermines the one person, one vote principle that is so important in our democracy. While smaller states may receive slightly less individual attention under a popular vote, every vote would carry equal weight. Candidates would still visit a variety of large and small states to maximize their vote totals.",1
"A possible counterargument is that foreign powers could try to influence the national outcome through campaigns in just a few highly populated states. However, this same risk exists in our current system, as opponents might spend large sums in swing states. Additionally, switching to the popular vote may increase national voter turnout and civic participation, countering any foreign influence efforts.",1
"In conclusion, adopting a nationwide popular vote would make every citizen's ballot equally important and better align presidential elections with our democratic values. While the Electoral College was well-intentioned, it no longer serves the needs of our large, mobile society. I urge you to support election of the president by popular vote to give voice to all Americans. Please let me know if you have any other questions.",1
Thank you for your time and consideration.,1

"The value of using this technology to read students emotional expressions is an extremely smart idea. They see if they were confused or not. This software could help kids understand their assignments easier, explain more things thoroughly, and break the subject down into smaller sections.",0
"The way that this software could help kids understand their assignments easier is that it could read their emotions while they're taking notes and the teacher says something they don't understand. The software could then read that emotion of confusion and show them a simpler way to understand it. Thus making the lesson easier to understand, so they could actually do their work right instead of doing it completely wrong.",0
"Another way that this software could help students understand things better is that it could explain more thoroughly. For example, a student could be sitting in math class and taking notes. The kid might not understand what the teacher means as he's talking about a specific formula. The software could recognize the look and explain it better to the student so that they understand what they meant.",0
"The last reason why this software could be useful is that it could break down in the lesson into smaller sections. A kid could be completely lost on what he's learning about in science, and they're overwhelmed by everything together. The program could recognize the confusion of the kid. It could then break the whole lesson apart and explain it one step at a time so could make more sense to them.",0
"In conclusion, this software could do amazing things to help students understand and comprehend a lesson better than anything else. While this program will probably never be available for my education, it would be amazing asset for future students. The software could make it easier for assignments to be understood, explain a lesson further than the teacher did, and break lessons down into smaller sections. This software is the future for our world's education.",0
"They students need to take a test be for they Allowed you to do online classes date will help the students to stay home then the schools will be happy for this. It will not work for some students to have learning at home they need to come to classes then day will have more dies in the classes. If day allowed the students not to be in classes they want students to take online classes it will be a problem for some students because some students will home to play video game at home. Some students will be able to learning at home, but he needs someone to look him or her to tell the students what to do because it will help the students what to learn something at home. They really try to help some students to have Education in the world it Imports because some part in the world need this type of Education then students will learn different thing. In my country this will not help the students to do online classes at home because in the morning the students have to look for something to eat if you don't have anything to eat date will not help you to looking at your book and completion or lest you go to the market to sale. Then you can have something to eat. Some families are very poor because it will not work for the poor people to have the type of Education in they home date way the need some students in classes because the school will help these students to have learning in the classes.",0

"When people ask for advice, they sometimes talk to more than one, single person. In the past, I have asked more than one person what they think. Most people also ask more than one person for something as well. Seeking multiple opinions is good because you can get multiple opinions and compare them, and you can get multiple opinions for things people have experienced and haven't experienced.",0
"The first reason people should ask for more than one opinion is they could get multiple opinions and compare them. It's sort of like taking a survey, but in this case you are surveying peoples opinion. You would take someone's opinion then go to another person and get their opinion. You could do this with more than just one person. For example, if you are going to try a new food at a restaurant, you go either ask people in person what their opinion is or go online to the review section of the restaurant website or rating website. You would then take everyone's opinion and see the pros and cons for the food you want to try. The pros and cons could be about one certain dish you might want to try or about the restaurant its self. This is how taking many opinions is good for making a better choice.",0
"The second reason you should take multiple opinions is you can get opinions from people who have done and haven't done whatever you are trying to get an opinion on. You could take someone's opinion if they have done whatever you are getting an opinion for. They might have experienced it before, but you could also take someone's opinion if they haven't tried it before but get their opinion on what they think of it. For example, if you want to try something like a new ride at an amusement park, you could ask someone who has already ride the ride and someone who hasn't. You would get the person who already rode the ride their opinion of what they thought of the ride when they rode it like did it have loopty-loops, if it is really fast, or if it is a spinning ride. You would then get the person who hasn't tried it and see what they think from just seeing and hearing about the ride. Furthermore, you could then get the pros and cons of each and decide whether to go on it or not. For this reason, you should take more than just one opinion.",0
"In conclusion, you should get more than just one opinion about making a better choice. You could get multiple opinions and compare them. You could also get them from people who have experienced whatever you are getting an opinion about and someone who hasn't done it. For these reasons, you should get more than just one opinion to make a choice.",0
"The Electoral College is something that should be kept for our government voting system. When people vote for the president and are not really voting for their president they want, they should be able to directly vote for the person they want to win. With the Electoral College in place, you are not able to do so. There should be two forms of voting.",0
"When the poll is taking place, people should place their votes and have those be shipped off to the Electoral College and have the votes be taken there. But, there should be another copy for the votes to be cast directly to the election. This will help when someone wins electoral vote and loses national popular vote and the other way around. It can still happen to where someone wins electoral votes and wins national popular vote. With this method, their will be fewer debate over who should truly be the president they choose.",0
"If any of these options are off of the table, then there should be a law that there should be no winner-takes-all majority voting. When 49% of the state want one president to win and 51% want the other, that should be equally distributed across the presidential election. When there is that little of a gap in between votes, that is the reason why people win national popular vote over electoral votes right there. People should obviously get the president that they want their country to be watched over by, but there should be a little change in how that president comes to be.",0
"To be president, you need to catch the peoples eye and try to do great things for your country. People who vote for you, obviously want you to be there president and have you take care of them. When you win the electoral college votes, but lose the national popular votes, that means you have lost the election. This is another reason why the winner-takes-all majority vote for the electoral college should be taken off of the table.  ",0
"Recently the principle made a big change to our school. He decided that all students should participate in at least one extracurricular activity. After I heard about this, I started thinking of how this can impact our school. Some students might disagree with this new change, but I actually agree with the principle's decision. There might be some minor ways on how this can effect students, however, I think this could be a great way to improve students mental health. Students should at least participate in one extracurricular activity because this could make students more productive, help students find something they might be passionate in, and have a great way to make new friends.",0
"The first reason why I agree with the principle is that it can make students more productive after school. There are many students who can get lazy when they come home from school. Most of the time, I can be one of those students. Usually when I come home after school, I always get the urge to jump on my bed and just watch videos on my phone. When I get on my phone, I can get so invested in it, that I don't even realize I have a lot of homework assignments to do.",0
"Being lazy is just unhealthy for your body and mental health. Most students probably have been in the same situation as me. Although, if those students were to be in an extracurricular activity, they would be more productive. For example, an activity like playing soccer can help someone's brain/and body to be more active. Another example would be participating in any art-related activity, which can help students think more creatively. Doing any extracurricular activity would be way better than to sit down and watch on a device. To sum up, extracurricular activities are a good way to help someone have a productive task to do.",0
"The second reason why I agree with the principle is that extracurricular activities can help some students find something to be passionate in. There are some students who might not have any activity or hobby they're passionate in. If those students had to take an extracurricular activity, they would have a more chance of finding something they like. Some students might even end up liking an activity they never thought they would. Every school gives many options in extracurricular activities. If a student tries out an activity, and they don't like it, they can always try a different one. Also, another benefit in finding an activity you like, is getting a lead to a career you might want to have in the future. It's always good to know what you're passionate in, so you can have more options for future careers.",0
"The final reason why I agree with the principle is that joining in extracurricular activities can be a great way to make new friends. Socializing and making friends is important for anyone's mental health. Friends can be supporting and a helping hand at any time. The friends you make can also build a strong character in you. If you join an extracurricular activity that you really like, it can be easier to make friends because they will have the same interest as you. Because of the similar interests, the friends you make through an activity can be closer than the friends you make in class. Making friends gets you to know other people in your school, and it's better to know more people, so you can feel more comfortable at school. All in all, extracurricular activities can be the best opportunity in making great friends.",0
"There may be other ways that extracurricular activities can benefit students, but the reasons I thought of were the most important to me. With extracurricular activities students can be more productive, find an activity they might be passionate in, and make new friends. Also, extracurricular activities can play an important role in life by leading you to a career. For the students who don't agree in partaking in any activity, just keep in mind that It's always better to try new activities because you might end up liking it! ",0
"Dear, State senator we should keep the Electoral college. The college is a process, not a place. The process consists of the selection of the electors, the meeting of the electors where they vote for president and vice. The counting of electoral voters by congress. State's entitled allotment of electors equals the number of members in its congressional delegation.",0
The college is widely regarded as an anachronism. The Electoral college despite its lack of Democratic Pedigree. We shouldn't have to change to election by popular vote for President. The Electoral college looks like a big help to President. The founding fathers established it in the constitution as a compromise between election of the president. The college has many electors.270 electoral voters is required to elect the president.,0
"Under 23rd amendment of constitution District of Columbia is allocated 3 electors. It could be argues the Electoral college method of selecting the president may turn off potential voters. There may be a few things i don't agree with about the Electoral college. I don't like how voters don't vote for the president but for slate of electors. The Electoral college is one by far the best things, It don't need to be taken from us. Many good things the college does.",0

"I'm a science at NASA discussing, and I'm trying to discover how did these type of faces get on this planet?. So me, PROPER_NAME and my friend are trying to see how did this face get here. Then I go do some research on it and I typed the face of Mars and it popped up. While I'm doing that I start to read about what it is saying, its says these faces have come from aliens. So I look at the picture real closely and I also look at what I see in the back grown and I see all the little holes that are there. But on April 5,1998, when Mars global surveyor colonia for the first time they shot photos of the pictures, and they showed them. But they're also investing in those pictures and really seen where they came from. But most people where not happy because the face of Mars was located 41 degrees north martian latitude where it was winter in April 1996. But nevertheless on April 8, 2001, a cloudless summer day in codon, and it was 25 degrees to center the face of Mars. But there was no type of alien that made all those faces, it was just all the America and the things that have changed over time. And also the little holes that was in the background of the picture were the rocks that hit the area, and it must have got little hole sin it.  ",0
" Promptness is something that we all strive for, but sometimes things don't go as planned, and we need to think first before taking action. In my opinion, being prompt is crucial in many aspects of life, and it's important to prioritize it.",1
"Firstly, being prompt is important in the workplace. If you're late to work, it can lead to missed deadlines and a loss of productivity. It's also important to be prompt when it comes to meeting deadlines or completing tasks. For example, if you're working on a project, and you miss a deadline, it could lead to delays and additional work.",1
"Secondly, being prompt is also important in personal relationships. If you're always late to appointments or events, it can damage your relationships and make people feel like you don't value their time. It's important to be respectful of other people's time and to make an effort to be prompt whenever possible.",1
"However, being prompt is not always easy. Sometimes, unexpected events can occur that are beyond our control, such as traffic jams or public transportation delays. In these situations, it's important to be flexible and adaptable. We can try to plan ahead and leave extra time for unexpected events, or we can find alternative routes or modes of transportation.",1
"Another way to be prompt is to prioritize tasks and create a schedule. By creating a schedule and breaking down larger tasks into smaller, more manageable ones, we can ensure that we're making progress and staying on track. It's also important to be mindful of our time and to avoid distractions.",1
"In conclusion, being prompt is crucial in many aspects of life. It's important to prioritize it and make an effort to be prompt whenever possible. By being respectful of other people's time, planning ahead, and avoiding distractions, we can ensure that we're making the most of our time and achieving our goals.",1

"I am writing to express my view that the Electoral College system should be kept for electing the President of the United States. While moving to a popular vote seems appealing in some ways, I believe the Electoral College encourages greater voter participation and protects the interests of smaller states.",1
"One concern about a popular vote is that it could discourage voter turnout, especially in states that are not considered swing states. Currently, candidates try to appeal to voters in competitive states, which encourages high voter participation in those locations. However, with a national popular vote, candidates may focus all their attention on heavily populated areas. This could reduce incentives for people in other parts of the country to vote. ",1
It is also important to remember that the United States was designed as a federal republic composed of individual state governments. The Electoral College system helps to balance state and national interests. Smaller population states rightfully worry that candidates would ignore their issues in a national popular vote. The current system guarantees that smaller states still have a meaningful say in presidential elections. This helps maintain the federal character of our system of government.,1
"Of course, some critics argue that the Electoral College can result in a president being elected despite losing the nationwide popular vote. While this has happened a few times, it is a reflection of how candidates must build a nationwide coalition, not just win the most total votes. A nationwide plurality system may also have its flaws.",1
"In conclusion, while the popular vote idea has some intuitive appeal, I believe the Electoral College overall serves our democratic process better by encouraging broad voter participation and respecting the interests of all states. It has worked reasonably well for over two centuries and remains the best system for presidential elections. I hope you will consider opposing any proposals to abandon it.",1
Thank you for your consideration. Let me know if you have any other questions.,1
"Sincerely,",1

"I think that you shouldn't make it a mandatory thing. If kids wanted to volunteer they would. I think everyone should do something to help the community, but making someone do something they really don't care about will just make them mad and or dislike you. I know not everyone will like what you do and roles would be roles. But still. Maybe if we had a bunch of fun volunteering projects kids could do through school it would make it easier for them to see volunteering doesn't have to be just like picking up trash (which is a good thing but honestly no fun) you could go to a pet shelter and play with the animals. Or I always that it would be fun to train service dogs for the blind or something like that. Or go to a soup kitchen and feed the homeless, that's what I do. I don't know, I don't think the principal would change his mind about roles for the school by one latter from a student, but it's just my opinion on community projects. Thanks for reading my letter!",0

"Community service is something people do voluntary, not something that should be required. Students have other things to worry about such as studying, homework, chores etc. There are already a lot of adults who volunteer for community service, and there's people who by law are forced to. Kids on the other hand shouldn't have to. Students don't need something else on their shoulders, school is for learning and nothing else.",0
"Students have to study no matter what. Community service is like an obstacle that prevents kids to actually study. Already there are many students who don't study at all, and making all students do community service would discourage the small percentage who do. Doing things like cleaning and taking care of younger kids can be tiring. Even adults get tired of doing these things, imagine how a minor would feel. When a student is tired and has the choice to study or not they would most likely rather not; well after so much work they have just done. Not studying can lower test scores, and not to mention lower student grades.",0
"As studying weren't enough of an issue, with all this community service where can a student find time to do their homework? Of course, those who choose to volunteer for community service find their way; they figure out their own schedule. But what about those new goers? A change of schedule can be very frustrating, especially when it means doing your homework late at night. There's another reason why it could affect the use of homework. When you have such a tight schedule (which can be harder to those who play sports or clubs) your only option is to do your homework at night. Which is awful because students end up having fewer hours of sleep, which is required for a good healthy day. Homework should be done right after school, but with this new task it wouldn't be possible.",0
"What about certain chores students have to do at home? Parents as we all know are very strict about chores, and when a kid doesn't accomplish them, parents can get really mad. Of course, you can prevent that by actually doing them in first place; but what if you have to community service first? Your parents might understand the situation you in, so they'll probably postpone ""clean up"" day to the weekend. Which is the only days a student has to forget about their troubles at school. There's another reason, socially this would ruin social activity after school; since students have to study, do their homework, and do their chores all before bedtime. Chores are enough, why do city chores the community already volunteers for.",0
"In conclusion, I believe the idea of making students do community service is absurd and completely irrational. Students have social lives they need to fulfill. Our tax money is going to the cause anyway so why bother. People get paid for this stuff, so it shouldn't be a privilege. Community service just shouldn't be required in school, it should be voluntary.",0

"I think that schools should not allow parents to monitor their kids grades and attendance online. First, it's like, totally invasion of privacy. Like, I get that parents want to know how their kids are doing in school, but they don't need to know every single grade and attendance record. That's like, between me and my teacher, you know? It's not their business.",1
"And also, it's like, really stressful for kids. Like, if my parents are always checking my grades, I'm going to feel so much pressure to get good grades. And what if I don't? Like, what if I'm not doing well in a certain subject? My parents are going to be all like, ""What's wrong with you? Why aren't you getting A's?"" And it's just, like, too much.",1
"And also, it's not like, good for kids to have their parents always checking up on them. Like, we need to learn how to be responsible and independent. If our parents are always watching us, we're never going to learn how to do things on our own. It's like, they need to trust us and give us some space.",1
"But, like, on the other hand, I can see why parents would want to monitor their kids grades and attendance. Like, they want to make sure we're doing well and not, like, skipping school or something. But, like, there are other ways to do that. Like, they could just ask us how we're doing, and we can tell them. Or they could, like, talk to our teachers and get a progress report or something.",1
"So, in conclusion, I think that schools should not allow parents to monitor their kids grades and attendance online. It's just, like, too much, and it's not good for kids. We need some privacy and independence. But, like, I get why parents would want to do it, so maybe there can be, like, a compromise or something.",1
"Why would anyone want to become a Seagoing Cowboy, you might ask. There are actually many reasons why someone should become a Seagoing Cowboy. Like I said, ""The cattle-boat trips were an unbelievable opportunity for a small-town boy.""",0
"If you are working as a Seagoing Cowboy, then you know the feeling of when you accomplish something great. It's all one big rush of happiness, excitement, and success. Later on in life you will get to say, ""I helped someone, and I'm proud"" That is just one of the many reasons.",0
"If you like working with animals, then this might be a job for you. When I was working for the Seagoing Cowboys program, I got to work as a watchman. When you are a watchman you have to check on the animals every hour. That was an amazing experience, trust me.",0
"Being a Seagoing Cowboy isn't all work all the time. You can find time to have fun like I did. I got to play exciting volleyball and baseball games. Along with that, I had time to read, box, fence, whittle, and play in table-tennis tournaments.",0
"When you are a Seagoing Cowboy you get to visit amazing place such as I. You can get the chance to go to through the Panama Canal and tour a castle in Crete just on your way to China!

"Wouldn't it be cool if everyone participated in an extracurricular activity? I feel that everyone should be involved in an after school event, it can be beneficial in so many ways. Kids would make new friends, wouldn't be bored all the time, and it would be healthier for them.",0
"Having an extracurricular activity would be healthier for students. Sitting at home all the time is not healthy for anybody, many people can become depressed, lonely or just really bored. Getting out of the house more, you can get more exercise. It's healthier to be around people then to be alone all the time at home.",0
"This is also a perfect way to make new friends. A lot of people have friends that they hang out with all the time, this would be a good way to have more friends. Meeting someone at an after school event can mean that you share similar interests. That being said you would get along more because you can take about you similar hobby.",0
"A lot of kids go home and become bored because ta have nothing to do. Finding something to do can also be difficult. Having an extracurricular activity would give you something to do after school. Some kids get into trouble when they have nothing else to do, but if they had something to do after school hey should be fine.",0
"Although some people would not agree with me, if you can be healthier, make new friends, and avoid being bored, having an extracurricular activity wouldn't be such a bad idea. All in all, having an after school activity can be beneficial in so many ways.",0

"Looking over the Electoral College, there has come to be a few interesting details. Yes, the process is beautiful thought out but as we look at it deeper it has its flaws. The founding fathers have given us the Electoral College, which anarchist are very unappreciative viewing it as a non-democratic way to vote.",0
"If the Electoral College system goes, then Americans can have their full Constitutional rights. Using this process voters are not voting for the elector of their choice, voters are voting on higher qualified voters to vote for the elector. The whole process is a violator of the amendment entitled to voting. Having this maze of voting for voters, what if a voter confuses of whom the elector is voting for so their vote ISIN actually going to the candidate of their choice. In 1960 before the election of John F. Kennedy, the segregationists of the Louisiana legislator came very close to replacing all the Democratic electors with electors who opposed John F. Kennedy. So all the voters in favor of JFK. Will be voting against him and all the Electoral College votes would be going to the other candidate.",0
As Bradford Plume says in an excerpt from:,0
"The Indefensible Electoral College: Why even the best-laid defenses are wrong, ""At the most basic level, the electoral college is unfair to voters."" Plume makes a very valid point because of the size of states. The electoral College's number of representatives are as big as their states' population. So if all the representatives in Alaska vote on the Republican candidate, and most of the people in California vote for the Democratic candidate, the Electoral College vote in California overrules the vote in Alaska.",0
"The Electoral College can make some voters not want to vote, usually because of their state size their vote doesn't count as much. Many voters in larger states refuse to vote because their vote won't really change the Electoral Collage's vote. The voters don't have total control over an elector, so the whole election crisis could happen again.",0
"In conclusion, the Electoral College may have worked when the colonies were small and the votes counted, but today the modern society doesn't appreciate its lack of Constitutional rights. All we ask is for our right to vote to be given to us, so we can take part in our government.",0

The thing they saw is just a natural landform. There is no evidence that someone could have made it. It's just the was people look at it making them think that it's a face. Things occur and just move things and make them look different. They may also make different shapes and objects. There is no evidence that aliens could have done it.,0
"My opinion is that the way things move things could have crashed into it and made it look like a face. Its just something natural that happened. They don't have enough evidence to show what caused the face to form. Many things could have happened for the face to form, but it doesn't mean that aliens or ancient things could have done this.",0
NASA has been putting a lot of money into this to see what caused this thing to form. They think there is life on that planet and that is what caused it to form and something made that thing that looks like a face. They saw that there wasn't any alien movement that it WS just a natural landform and that's what is. No aliens could have done this face. The thing that they thought was a face was just a mesa.,0
All of this was just that they thought aliens had done the face. But then they discovered that there was no alien movement and figured out that it was just a mesa. They were done with their research because they had nothing else to do with the mesa that they thought something had formed it.  ,0
" The debate surrounding whether high school students should take school programs that allow for early graduation in three years instead of the traditional four years is an ongoing one. While some argue that these programs provide students with the opportunity to graduate early and start working or attending college sooner, others believe that the benefits of taking these programs are outweighed by the potential drawbacks.",1
"One of the main arguments in favor of early graduation programs is that they allow students to graduate early and begin their careers or further their education sooner. This can be particularly beneficial for students who are not planning on attending college, as they can start working and earning money sooner. Additionally, students who are able to graduate early may be more motivated to pursue higher education or other post-secondary opportunities.",1
"However, there are also several potential drawbacks to consider when it comes to early graduation programs. For example, students who take these programs may be required to take classes during the summer or after school, which can be time-consuming and may interfere with their ability to participate in extracurricular activities or spend time with family and friends. Additionally, students who take these programs may be less able to take elective courses, such as foreign language, nutrition, music classes, computer skill class, or HPE, which can be an important part of a well-rounded education.",1
"Another potential drawback of early graduation programs is that they may put students at a disadvantage when it comes to college admissions. Many colleges and universities require students to complete a certain number of credit hours before they can graduate, and students who take early graduation programs may not have the same opportunities to complete these credit hours as those who take the traditional four-year program.",1
"In conclusion, while early graduation programs may provide some benefits for high school students, it is important to carefully consider the potential drawbacks before deciding whether to take one. Students should weigh the pros and cons and make an informed decision about whether an early graduation program is the right choice for them.",1
"There are many advantages of not using a car. It's a good opportunity to lower air population, reduce greenhouse gas emissions from tailpipes. In addition, everyone is getting active instead of using a car to transport them where they need to go.",0
"Passengers are responsible for 12 percent of greenhouse gas emissions in Europe. 50 percent in some car-intensive areas in the United States. Not using cars can lower air populations. Congestion was down 60 percent in the capitol of France after 5 intensifying smog. The smog rivaled Beijing, China, which is known as one of the most populated cities in the world. After banking even numbered license plates the smog cleared enough.",0
"Another advantage in not using cars is everyone getting active. Instead of everyone driving everywhere millions of people hiked, biked, skated, or took buses. People are interacting with each other. Many people have said that it has released stress and lowered air population. Pedestrian, bicycle, private cars, commercial and public transportation traffic are woven into connected network to save time, conserve resources lower emissions and improve safety.",0
There are many advantages to not using cars. No air population and many other things. The question is what are you going to do to help?  ,0
"My opinion about If school students have to a four-day school week. The students and teachers can get a more free DAR, that day we can take sleep, study for other you need study something, enjoy with your family, develop your self and what do I want to do. I can have many good something for you. But the other days, you have the school day two more hours. You need to think about now. We have seven hours on school, you dose not tired for long times in school? The seven hour is very long time,",0
"every early morning all students wake up the May de am 5:30 or 6:00, you need take prepare to go to school, and stay there for seven hours. But if we have a four-day school week and expending the school day two hours, you should lose the two hours from much something. For example, I can't have a sleep, study for you need to know something, enjoy with my family, develop my self, and what do I want to do. Because we have a four-day school week and expending the school day two hours. If we have two more hours in school, we need stay two more hours in school, more study. I don't want to losing my five day's happy and free. We need more think about what is perfect for us.",0
"Positive attitude and humility are two important traits that can greatly impact an individual's success in life. While there are many factors that contribute to success, having a positive attitude and being humble are crucial. These traits not only help individuals achieve their goals, but also help them navigate through difficult times and overcome obstacles.",1
"Having a positive attitude is essential for achieving success in life. A positive attitude allows individuals to focus on the positive aspects of a situation, rather than dwelling on the negative. This mindset can help individuals overcome challenges and find opportunities where others may see only obstacles. For example, a student who is struggling in a particular subject may have a negative attitude towards the subject and give up on it. However, if the student has a positive attitude, they may continue to work hard and find a way to understand the subject, leading to success in that area.",1
"Humility is also a key factor in achieving success in life. Being humble allows individuals to recognize their strengths and weaknesses and work on improving themselves. It also allows individuals to learn from others and accept constructive criticism. For example, a successful business owner may be humble and open to feedback from their employees, leading to a more successful business.",1
"It's also important to never give up on pursuing your dreams. Many successful individuals have faced setbacks and obstacles in their journey to success, but they never gave up. For example, J.K. Rowling, the author of the Harry Potter series, faced numerous rejections from publishers before finally finding one that was willing to take a chance on her. However, she never gave up on her dream and continued to work on the series, eventually leading to its success.",1
"In conclusion, having a positive attitude and being humble are two important traits that can greatly impact an individual's success in life. These traits not only help individuals achieve their goals, but also help them navigate through difficult times and overcome obstacles. Additionally, never giving up on pursuing your dreams is crucial for achieving success in life. Real-life examples such as J.K. Rowling's journey to success demonstrate the importance of these traits and the impact they can have on an individual's success.",1
"The ways we know that the face is just a natural landform and not something created by Aliens is because we have done real research on the Landform. Not only that but when we took the pictures we used our cameras absolute maximum resolution, so it would be as clear as possible. Plus the evidence has changed. Each pixel in the 2001 image spans 1.56 meters, compared to 43 meters per pixel in the best 1976 Viking photo. So we know that the planet is changing and that's how we know that the landform isn't created by Aliens. Plus we have a Surveyor which is a mapping spacecraft that normally looks straight down and scans the planet like a fax machine in narrow 2.5 km-wide strips. The number one way we know it is a landform and not something created by Aliens is because was a rule of thumb, you can discern things in a digital image 3 times bigger than the pixel size,  he added. so, if there were objects in this picture like airplanes on the ground or Egyptian-style pyramids or even small shacks, you could see what they were!. Also, we have pictures from 1976, 1998, and 2001 that shows its change and that it's a landform.",0
People make many facial expressions to tell how they are feeling about certain people or situations. There really a need for a software to detect how a student emotional expressions are? Classrooms do not need technology for student to tell what their emotional expressions are. Students peers are more than capable of telling weather the person likes something or not. It's also a waste of technology to be put in a classroom.,0
"One reason why technology to read students is not beneficial is facial expressions can be seen and dozen'r have to be heard. In the passage paragraph four it states that, ""The facial expressions for each emotion are universal and individuals often show varying degrees of expressions."" Another reason is humans are the detectors of weather another persons like something or not. In paragraph five it states that, ""In fact, we humans perform this same ""calculation"" every day. For instance, you can probably tell hoe a friend is feeling simply by the look on her face."" Why need technology when people have their own knowledge of what's going on with a person. Last reason is using your muscles called palpabraeus, in paragraph eight it explains that using your muscles you can spot certain faces a person is trying to make. It says, ""To an expert faces don't lie; these muscles clues are used to spot when a smile politician or celebrity isn't being truthful.""",0
"In conclusion using technology is not a good use to read student in a classroom. There is no reason because there are people when it can detect other people's expressions. Students also using their own resources/knowledge. In the passage it states that, ""moving your facial muscles not only express emotions, but also may help produce them."" No need technology to tell a person that. ",0
"Dear State Senator,",0
"I think we should keep the Electoral College. It's been with us for a very long time, passed down from our founding fathers. They establish the Electoral College in the Constitution for a reason. There is no need for us to get rid of it. It's been helping us choose the right president for this country for decades. Sure the popular vote is important too, but I think the Electoral College is more helpful and here is why.",0
"The electoral votes know more about who and what they are voting for. Because they pay more attention to the campaign than the people. It also helps with close or an even amount of the popular votes, so it could break the tie even though it is unlikely we can always have the Electoral College to decide. Sometimes when people vote they don't even know who to vote for and could just check the box they see a name for. They don't know what the elective could do for the future of America. Some also vote for certain electives because someone told them too or because someone else voted for that elective. Some candidates go and try to win increase his or her plurality and persuade the people of certain states that they know they'll win to become president instead of trying to get all the states too vote for him or her. Which won't be that successful of a president as stated in paragraph 19. Candidates focus their campaign on the toss-up states because they know what they are voting for. Which awards electoral votes to the candidate. Popular votes help by letting the candidate get more electoral votes because of the winner take all basis as said in paragraph 18.",0
"That is why I think we should keep the Electoral College. It helps out with a lot of things. It has helped us for many years and have give us great presidents for America. Furthermore, it makes the method of choosing a president easier too. Hopefully the Electoral College will stay with America for a long time.",0
"Students who take an online classis do not have many benefits because, they feel lazy to study on their own, sometimes do not their assignments and also do not have people they will be competed with. They also do not have much confident to speak with lots of people or give a speech in front of many people, which makes someone who attends an everyday class with a lot of people to be experienced than a person who takes an online class. People with much experience in a lot of things do not always have fake people in their lives.",0
"People always think that taking an online class is very good, which is totally wrong. When taking online classes you do not get to know the people who are performing much better than you in class, but when you go to an everyday class in a school, you know the people who are better than you in different subjects. When you take an online class you do not get people who will help you solve your problems in many courses; for example, when you take an online class, and you fail in a subject you would not know those who performed good in that subject, that means that you will not know how to study hard to perform good next time. Online students always find it difficult to study because, they do not see their mates in school learning which will also encourage them to that same thing. This means that taking an online class will not be advisable for students.",0
"Also, when taking an online class, you do not get to interact with different kind of people throughout the world. People who take an online class do not always have the confident to speak in public and do not always have the lot of friends. Having friends is one of the important things in our life. When you have friends you share each other's problems and solve it together. This means that when you take an online class you do not always have enough friends to speak to or to share your problems with. For instance, when you are given the opportunity to give a speech in front of a lot of people, you begin to shiver or start stammering because you are not use to speaking in public. But when a person who attends classes which involves a lot of individuals, they always have the confident not to only speak in front of their mates but to also speak to those who are much older than them without any fears.",0
"Moreover, people who always involve themselves in a video conference do not always know the people their dealing with in their business or do not always have much idea about their business meeting. When one is present at work place all the time, he or she runs the business smoothly without any misunderstanding with anybody. Again when having a business with someone on a video conference, you do not know if the person you are dealing with is a fraud or not. So people who do an online business always end up putting themselves into trouble. When one is always present at their business places, they always know the people who are hardworking and can make the business go much further and those who are lazy. When you are always at your work place, you make your members to respect and adopt your policies.",0
"People who take online classes do not understand much better because, the teacher is not always around them when they need help with the topic that they not understand. But hen you are in an everyday school classes, when a teacher always teach, and you do not understand you always know where to locate him to ask for help. Even when the teacher is not around, you can find different teachers who also teaches that subject, and they will always find a solution to your problem. So students who attend an everyday classis perform much better than those who take an online class.",0
"All the above-mentioned, which includes, it makes them interact with different people, find a lot of friends, get to know good people in a business, ask teachers for help when they have a problem really shows that taking an online class or a video conference is not really beneficial for an individual. Once all these measures are taken into consideration, people will see that going to an everyday class or making yourself present at a business meeting is more important to a person.",0
"I am usually a bit skeptical about new technologies like the Facial Action Coding System, but I am opened to the idea of new technology. In this case I support the value of using this technology to read students' emotional expressions. It is pretty interesting how the Facial Action Coding System (FACS) can determine the emotion someone is feeling by examining the muscle movements in the face. The FACS could be a very useful tool in many ways in the near future.",0
"The FACS uses facial moments to determine whether a person is feeling happy, sad, surprised, angry, disgusted, fearful, or sad. The interesting thing about the FACS is that it can determine whether the person is faking an emotion. For example, the article stated,"" But in a false smile, the mouth is stretched sideways using the zygotic major and a different muscle, the rigorous"". So by examining muscle movements in the face, the FACS can determine whether the person is faking an emotion or actually feeling it. In the future I think therapist could use the FACS to help determine how his/her patent is actually feeling. Dr. Huang stated,"" A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored,"" Dr. Huang predicts."" Then it could modify the lesson, like an effective human instructor"". I think that this would be an effective way to father advance education in our society.",0
"In conclusion, I agree with the use of the Facial Action Coding System. I believe it will help us advance as a society and make things less difficult. I feel as if the technology could be used in many ways besides schools. Many professions, such as psychologist could use this technology.",0
"Cell phones are a big issue while driving. Lots of accidents have happened in the past because of people being on their cell phones while driving. The main people that do text or play on their phones while driving are teenagers. There are many ways of solving this problem, but I am only going to be talking about one way to solve it.",0
"One way that we can solve this problem is we can put blue tooth radios in our cars so that if someone calls you there would be a way to answer your phone without picking it up. Most of the newer cars have a Bluetooth radio in them, so you don't have to buy one. Although older model cars don't have them you can buy them and install them. Over half of the accidents in the US happen because of people being or checking their phones.",0
"Although it is never okay to use your phone while driving I think that if you solved that problem by getting a radio. If you have a Bluetooth radio, then there should be less of a chance of you getting in an accident because you would be on your phone less. Even though that is a solution you should still never touch you phone while operating a vehicle.  ",0
"Dear Principal,",0
"In my opinion, student should be allowed to bring cell phones to school and use them during lunch periods and other free times, as long as the cell phones are turned off during class time. Students should be able to use their cell phones during lunch and free times because it can help them communicate with their parents and other peers.",0
"Students should be able to use their cell phones at lunch because it could help them find their friends on the large school campus. Sometimes, when you don't know what class your friend has before lunch it is hard to finds them, and by having a cell phone you can call them and find them easily. Also, during lunch some students would want to call their parents to ask if they are bringing them a lunch, or if they should buy a school lunch. Students may also want to ask their parents if they can go to a friends house after school, and so they will not need to pick them up.",0
"Having a cell phone would also help communication between students and friends from other schools, and between students and friends who are elsewhere on the campus. Students could call their friends to get help on homework or other school projects, or to plan what they are doing after school. Another reason why students should be able to have their cell phones on during free periods in school is because some students, if allowed, leave the campus to eat lunch, and their peers may be wondering where they are, when they are coming back, or to alert them that class has already started.",0
"By not letting students have their cell phones in school, they would be unable to communicate with their parents or peers. The school staff may be worried that students may use their cell phones during class, but if students are allowed to use them in their free times they most likely will not use them while they are learning. Teachers are afraid that students secretly use their cell phones during class, and that it takes away from their education. However, if a student is caught using their cell phone during learning time they know it could be confiscated for the rest of the day.",0
"Many students use their phones after school to contact their parents, friends, or carpool. Many times parents are late to pick their kids up, and if the kids have their cell phones they can call them to make sure they remember where they are. Students also use their cell phones after school to call their friends and ask if they want to hang out or go somewhere now that school ended.",0
"In conclusion, students should be able to bring phones to school and only use them during lunch or other free periods, because it makes communicating easier. As long as cell phones are turned off and not used in class, they will not be a disturbance to the students learning and education.",0

Doesw the electoral college work?,0
Yes the electoral college works cause it helps people get into a college that they would like to get into or want to it can make them happy and then later on in life they can make better choices to live free and get god jobs and have nice apartment and other things of that sort much it is for the.,0
''under the electoral college systems voters vote not for the president but for a slate of electors who in turn elect the president if you lived in Texas for instance and wanted to vote for John Kerry you'd vote for a slate of 34 democratic electors pledged to Kerry on the off chance that those electors won the statewide.,0
The electoral college is widely regarded as an anachronism a non-democratic method of selecting a president that ought to be overruled by declaring the accident who receives the most popular votes the winner the advocates of this potion.,0
A dispute over the outcome of an electoral college vote is possible it happened in 2000 but It's less likely than a dispute over the popular vote the reasons is that the winning candidates share of the electoral invariably exceeds his share of the popular vote in election for example Obama received 61.7 percent of the electoral vote compared to only 51.3 percent of the popular votes.,0
Cause most of the states award electoral votes on a winner take basis even a very slight plurality in a state landslide victory in that state a tie in the national nationwide vote is possible cause then total number of votes 538 is an even number but is highly likely.  ,0
"The Face on Mars was created by natural landforms, and it is impossible to have been created by aliens. First, there was no sign of alien interaction on Mars when the Face appeared. Next, it has been proven that the picture of the Face was actually a butte or mesa landform. Also, the other picture that was taken was more visual, and it was 3 times bigger than the original. The Face couldn't have been formed by alien life.",0
"One reason that proves that the Face is natural is that there has never been any alien interaction evidence on any planet. First, it is not possible for aliens to create a face in cement rock. Next, aliens wouldn't know what a face would look like because they wouldn't have a mirror, and they wouldn't even know what they look like. Finally, if aliens were able to move rock, they wouldn't have any tools to use. Aliens couldn't have formed the Face if we don't even know if they exist.",0
"Another reason that the Face is natural is that it has been proven that the Face was created by a butte or mesa landform. First, these landforms are very common in the American West. Next, Garvin knows that they are common because he mentioned,""it reminds me most of Middle Butte in the Snake River Plain of Idaho."" Garvin also said that the Middle Butte landform is the same height as the Face on Mars. If the Face is similar to another landform, it is most likely a natural landform.",0
"The final reason that the Face is natural is that the first picture that was taken, isn't as clear as the newer picture. First, when the original picture was taken, it was very cloudy and difficult to see during the winter in April. This could have been mistaken for alien markings because the sight wasn't easy to see. Finally, the newer picture that was taken had a digital image 3 times bigger than the original pixel in the first photo. The newer photo proves that aliens were not around at all.",0
"In conclusion, many people may have thought the Face was formed by aliens, but they only thought that because of the evidence they were given. The original photo was not clear, so the newer photo shows what it really looked like. The Face also had similar features to mesa and butte landforms which are very common in many areas. Since there was no evidence to show that aliens were there, it's not reliable to believe. The Face on Mars is just a natural landform that formed suddenly, and it can happen anywhere.",0
"The author of ""The Challenge of Exploring Venus"" makes a strong argument for why studying Venus is a worthy pursuit, despite the dangers it presents. The author provides several reasons why exploring Venus is important, and I agree with them.",1
"Firstly, the author points out that Venus is Earth's closest neighbor and is similar in size and mass to our planet. This makes Venus a unique and important planet to study, as it can provide valuable insights into the formation and evolution of our solar system. The author also notes that Venus has a thick atmosphere that traps heat, making it the hottest planet in the solar system. This extreme environment makes Venus an ideal place to study the effects of climate change and how it could impact Earth in the future.",1
"Secondly, the author highlights the potential benefits of studying Venus. The author states that Venus has abundant resources, such as metals and minerals, that could be used in the future. Additionally, the author notes that studying Venus could lead to the development of new technologies, such as advanced propulsion systems and life support systems. These technologies could be used in future space missions, making it easier and safer for humans to explore space.",1
"Finally, the author acknowledges the dangers of exploring Venus, such as the extreme heat and crushing pressure. However, the author also notes that these challenges can be overcome with the right technology and planning. The author suggests that NASA's Glenn Research Center is already working on developing new technologies that could be used to explore Venus, such as a new type of spacesuit that can withstand the extreme conditions.",1
"In conclusion, the author provides strong evidence to support the idea that studying Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers. The author highlights the unique features of Venus, the potential benefits of studying it, and the ways in which the challenges of exploring it can be overcome. I agree with the author that exploring Venus is an important and worthwhile endeavor, and I believe that it could lead to valuable discoveries and advancements in space exploration.",1
"Okay, here is my essay:",1
"Ugh, I know this is going to be soon annoying. But, like, I have to write about why older kids shouldn't be paired with younger kids. And honestly, I don't really want to. I mean, I know it's important and all, but it's just so... basic. But, like, here I am. So, here goes nothing.",1
"So, first, it's just really dangerous for younger kids to be paired with older kids. Like, think about it. Older kids are bigger and stronger, and they can totally hurt younger kids if they want to. And, like, what if the older kid is, like, a jerk? They could totally bully the younger kid and no one would even know. It's just not safe.",1
"And, like, even if the older kid isn't mean, they could still be a bad example for the younger kid. Like, if the older kid is, like, super lazy and never does their homework, the younger kid might start to think it's okay to not do their homework too. And then they'll get bad grades and stuff. Or, like, if the older kid is always on their phone and never pays attention to anything, the younger kid might start to think it's okay to be on their phone all the time too. And then they'll, like, miss out on all the fun stuff.",1
"And, like, one time at recess, I saw this older kid picking on a younger kid. Like, he was, like, pushing him around and stuff. And the younger kid was, like, crying and stuff. It was so sad. And I was, like, totally mad at the older kid. Why would he do that? He's supposed to be, like, a role model for the younger kids. But instead, he's just a jerk.",1
"So, like, older kids should totally respect younger kids and not be paired with them. It's just, like, the right thing to do. And if they don't, they could end up hurting someone or setting a bad example. And, like, who wants that? Not me, that's",1
"Sure, here is an essay arguing against the idea of a four-day school week with two extra hours of school each day, written as if it were a class assignment by an average 8th grade student:",1
"I think we should not have a four-day school week with two extra hours of school each day. I know some people think it would be good because it would give us more time to learn and do things we like, but I don't think it's a good idea.",1
"First, having two extra hours of school each day would be really hard for me and my friends. We would have to wake up early and stay up late, and it would be hard to keep up with our homework and other things we have to do. Plus, we would have to find something to do with all that extra time, and I don't know what we would do.",1
"Second, I think it would be unfair to some students. Some kids have a lot of responsibilities at home, like taking care of little siblings or helping out with the family business. They wouldn't be able to do that if they had to go to school for two extra hours each day. And some kids don't have as much free time as other kids, so they might not be able to do extra things they want to do.",1
"Third, I don't think we would learn as much if we had a four-day school week. We would have to cram all our learning into those extra two hours, and that would be hard. Plus, we might not be able to focus as well because we would be so tired from having to go to school for longer.",1
"Finally, I think it would be bad for our social lives. We would have to spend more time at school, which would mean we would see our friends less. And we wouldn't have as much time to hang out with them outside of school.",1
"In conclusion, I think having a four-day school week with two extra hours of school each day is not a good idea. It would be hard for some students, unfair, and bad for our learning and social lives. I think we should stick with the five-day school week and make the most of our time there.",1
"Disgusting pollution in the air! Terrible, but also deadly for our atmosphere, animals, and of course ourselves. As seen in paragraph 17, car emissions aren't only destroying our environment, but are also polluting our air to the point where Paris was covered for days in complete smog. That is why biking, walking, running, conservative driving, etc. are very needed in these days when everyone believes gas powered vehicles are our way of life. While people drive in cars constantly it creates more carbon emissions destroying our air and environment, but on the other hand more biking causes less traffic build up, healthier, and more businesses open up in walking distance because of the magnitude of participants walking/biking.",0
"To begin with, driving in cars isn't only extremely dangerous, it pollutes the air we all breathe! It makes our lungs become weaker and susceptible to disease and sickness. People may argue that giving up our most widely used transportation vehicle in the U.S. and very profitable vehicle industries, is too much. But I argue, that giving up something that will later in time completely destroy us and our earth is worth it. Pollution is a very serious problem that most people can't seem to wrap their head around. It's a deadly chemicals and waste being put into our air we breathe every second, yet we chose our vehicles over our precious air?!",0
"Next, understanding what more walking and less vehicular transportation can do for the world has amazing effects. Not only is it a healthy alternative to walk instead of driving because of our obesity issue here in America, but it cuts out pollution which hurts us and animals. More walking will create less traffic and more businesses and restaurants in walking distance, causing a better community and economy.",0
"In conclusion, more walking and biking is a much better alternative to driving cars constantly. Communities come together more, less traffic, more safety, no road rage, etc. These are all things that could come from walking instead of driving in vehicles.  ",0
"Limiting car usage has numerous advantages that can greatly benefit our society. In recent years, there has been a growing movement to separate suburban life from auto use, known as ""smart planning."" This movement acknowledges that automobiles are a major contributor to greenhouse gas emissions, with passenger cars alone responsible for 12 percent of emissions in Europe and up to 50 percent in some car-intensive areas in the United States (Rosenthal, 2009). By limiting car usage, we can effectively reduce greenhouse gas emissions and combat climate change.",1
"One successful example of limiting car usage is the German suburb of Vauban. In Vauban, street parking, driveways, and home garages are generally forbidden, making the streets completely ""car-free"" except for the main thoroughfare with a tram to downtown Freiburg (Rosenthal, 2009). As a result of this car-free lifestyle, 70 percent of Vauban's families do not own cars, and 57 percent sold a car to move there (Rosenthal, 2009). The residents of Vauban have experienced the benefits of limiting car usage firsthand. They report feeling less stressed and happier without the constant reliance on cars (Rosenthal, 2009). This demonstrates that limiting car usage can lead to improved quality of life for individuals.",1
"The benefits of limiting car usage are not limited to individual well-being. By reducing car dependency, we can also make suburbs more compact and accessible to public transportation. Smart planning focuses on placing stores within walking distance on a main street, instead of distant malls accessed by highways (Rosenthal, 2009). This makes it easier for residents to rely on public transportation and encourages walking or cycling for short distances. Additionally, limiting car usage can address the issue of smog caused by car emissions. In cities like Paris, driving bans have been enforced during periods of intense smog to reduce air pollution (Duffer, 2014). These bans have seen a significant decrease in congestion and smog levels (Duffer, 2014). ",1
"Furthermore, limiting car usage can have long-term benefits for our environment. A cultural shift towards reducing car ownership and driving has already been observed in the United States. Studies suggest that Americans are buying fewer cars, driving less, and getting fewer licenses (Rosenthal, 2013). This trend, if it persists, will have significant implications for carbon emissions and the environment. Transportation is the second-largest source of America's emissions, making it crucial to limit car usage to achieve the goals of reducing greenhouse gas emissions (Rosenthal, 2013). ",1
"In conclusion, limiting car usage has numerous advantages for individuals, communities, and the environment. By focusing on smart planning and reducing our reliance on cars, we can improve quality of life, reduce greenhouse gas emissions, and combat climate change. The success stories of communities like Vauban in Germany and the car-free day in Bogotá, Colombia, demonstrate the positive impact of such measures. It is essential that we prioritize the development of car-reduced communities and encourage the adoption of alternative forms of transportation. The shift away from car culture is not only beneficial for our environment but also for the overall well-being of individuals and communities.",1
"There are a few reasons why it's good to not drive your car. One, is that your car emits so many greenhouse gases. And greenhouse gases are band for the environment. Two, is that it promotes the use of bicycles and/or public transportation. Three, you really don't need your car anyway. Those are the reasons why I say that it would be good to limit car usage.",0
"My first reason why I say we should limit car use is because of the greenhouse gases we are releasing into the air. In article, ""In German Suburb, Life Goes On Without Cars"", paragraph 5, it says, ""Passenger cars are responsible for 12 percent of greenhouse gas emissions in Europe...and up to 50 percent in some car-intensive areas in the United Sates."", which means that 50 percent of the greenhouse gases that we release comes from cars.",0
"My second reason why we should limit car us is because if we use cars, we would use something else to get around like a bicycle. And if we use a bicycle we wouldn't be releasing any greenhouse gases."" It has seen the construction of 118 miles of bicycle paths, the most of any Latin American city, according to Mocks, the city's mayor."" stated in article, ""Car-free day is spinning into a big hit in Bogotá"". This is prey much encouraging us to use bicycles instead of cars.",0
"My third and final reason why we should limit our car usage is because we really don't need cars. We only use our cars to get us from place to place, stated article, ""The End of Car Culture"", paragraph 40 which says ""A car just a means of getting from A to B when BART Deon't work."" And why use a car, when you can use public transportation instead.",0
"Now that to know my reasons for limiting car usage, maybe you can try doing it. Limiting our car usage will give us less air pollution and give us a reason to ride our bikes instead of driving our car.",0
School policy,0
"It has come to my attention TEACHER_NAME I understand that you like the students to be very well-educated, and I see that you want them to be the best they can but for some student that is not the case. Some students want to play sports and do good at school, but sometimes they are ineligible to maintain a b average. Most of the time the kids that are playing sports feel that they can't play because they feel that they will not be able to maintain a c average, and they could not play.",0
Also it has come to my attention that the players that are on a team at the moment seem to be doing fine and need no help to bring their grades up. If you raise the grade average it could not only become a struggling manner for the player but also the league. By raising the average most players may not be eligible to play on the team and with not enough team members to play on the team they will have to shut down the team.,0
"Now I see that your argument is a very valid one and that every kid should stride for perfection but some kids and not only that but also the extracurricular events while maintaining these grades such as soccer, football, baseball, basketball, lacrosse, cheerleading, and hockey. They should stride to be the best at every class and not only that but the sport they are currently active in at the moment.",0
"Technology has had a profound impact on people's lives over the past several decades, with increasingly positive effects being felt in economic, educational, and familial aspects of life.",1
"In economic terms, technology has been the backbone of much of the dramatic capacity for wealth generation seen in many countries over the past decades. Technology has played a key role in allowing for the growth of global markets and increased mobility of goods and services through the world, allowing many countries to experience unprecedented economic growth.",1
"Technology has also had a dramatic effect on the educational sector. Digital technologies have increased the capacity to access and disseminate information incredibly quickly, allowing educational institutes to expand their reach further than ever before. Additionally, advances in computer-assisted education have allowed for more efficient and effective teaching and learning, with digital textbooks and interactive lessons playing a major part in modern classrooms.",1
"Finally, technology has deeply impacted the way we interact with family and loved ones. The proliferation of social networking services, video communication, and chat apps have cultivated a world of gadget-enabled communication, often allowing family members to stay in touch who would otherwise be distant. This has made it easier to bridge gaps of geographic distance, playing an important role in a world without physical borders.",1
"To sum up, technology has had a massive positive impact on people's lives, changing the economic, educational, and familial landscapes in ways that were once unimaginable. With the continuing advancement of technology, it is likely these effects will become even more pronounced in the years to come.",1
The technology I don't think will be able to read the expressions from the people in my classroom because i don't that there is such a technology like this because it sounds almost impossible to ever make something like this because it was back then and back then there was not anything like this or even until this day there is nothing like it,0
Then if there was ever something like this technology i don't think it will work very well considering that every one is in school and mostly when anybody is in school they are usually bummed out about being in school and I think the machine will read mixed emotions and the computer or the device will read everyone's emotions wrongs because like they say ID in the first paragraph how she had mixed emotions I think that that is pretty crazy to have for just one person because,0
I DNT think just one person can ever have that many emotions even if was a cartoon or a painting,0
"Lastly i don't think that everybody in my school will allow the emotion reader decide there emotions because like me, I will not feel comfortable with one of those readers lie many other people in my classroom will be comfortable with that reader to decade or find out there emotions because the reader might get the wrong emotion and people might start making fun of other peoples emotions and there might be a big argument with the reader and somebody might get mad because that is not how they are feeling and people might get mad because the reader might say something about somebody's business and people might get embarrassed about what other people might think about the hidden emotions.",0
"I think it's great for the older students to work with the younger student, because some young students haven't learned about what the older students learned, being a helper to younger ones especially in a school can be an amazing thing to do for example",0
They can help to teach them how to walk for the preschoolers,0
They can teach how to welcome people,0
It also helps them to have a great future,0
The Older students can also (maybe) earn some money for being an excellent helper to the younger students. It can also be a great hobby for the older students to teach younger students how to live their normal lives and to greet others. Another reason why the older students to help the younger students is an excellent idea is how to be respectful and trustworthy to others. There can be a chance where the older students can teach younger students how to help others as well for example,0
Pick up someone else stuff if it fell on the floor,0
Help an old person cross the road,0
Teach kids how to write neatly,0
This kind of program could help the environment so much. The students can also travel around the world to help younger students in other countries for example,0
United Kingdom,0
Norway,0
Sweden,0
Denmark,0
Canada,0
"And more! Having this type of need and help could this world so much. It helps across the country, around the world, all types of students can help others younger students how to live their lives, it can help go to collage and get a job that their very great at and in their job they can learn as well, it can make them get a talent from their job, so they can learn how to do stuff in their jobs and become very good at. So yes I would recommend for the older students to help younger students (even around the world) how to live their normal lives. It can help so much for others, and it teaches respect and that's why in every school they should have older students helping younger students and in other countries they should also have older students help younger students how to live normal lives and have a great future, and they can also help their families and other families.",0
"Dear Principle, 2/4/11",0
This world is turning into a darker place. The problem is that people don't care enough. We see homeless people on the side of the street and no one stops their cars. We tend to ignore what is bad. Out of sight out of mind. I think that is ridiculous. We need to help others. If we don't then who will? All students should participate in some form of community service.,0
"Lucky for us, we live in a pretty good town compared to others. In Africa people are starving and here people are dieting. Everything can improve though. We still have poverty. If we help those around us, we will make a ripple affect and can help the world. Ann Arbor has a lot of good opportunities to help our community. Food Gathers is a great program that I have worked with many times. They take food that is being thrown away and sort out the good or bad. Then with that food they make meals and feed the hungry. I think we could get groups of student to help out there sometimes. It could be a fun field trip that also teaches valuable lessons. Many organizations like this are beginning to pop up. We all need to help though. One person can create a ripple, but a group can create a wave.",0
"Another growing problem we have is laziness. I'll admit I'm lazy sometimes too. When students say it's a waste of time to help those less fortunate we have a problem. You don't need to spend hours but only a minute to help someone out. If someone is so busy with school work and extracurricular activities then they can go online and donate money, even just a dollar. Everyone can help they just need to know how and be motivated.",0
"When you help someone else you don't just help them, you help yourself. Helping those less fortunate is a humbling experience. You learn how to be a better person, and you want to try harder in life. I once worked at a soup kitchen. I saw kids just like me with parents just like mine, and they were starving. Furthermore, I am lucky, and I learned just how fortunate I was there. Furthermore, I know that if some 'bad' kids went, they would appreciate what they have and be a better student. School isn't just about math and writing its about preparing you for life. An experience like this would defiantly teach you a life lesson.",0
"Community service helps everyone. We can make an impact in our world by starting with just you and me. We need to motivate people to help, convince them that if they don't know one will. I strongly think that all student should require to perform community service. At least an hour of our time every month. Thank you for your time.",0

Driverless cars can help out in the future such as if a person is intoxicated, or falls asleep while driving the car would prevent an accident. Unlike the leap from the horse to the car the driverless car has many variables it has to go through before being released in mass quantity. There will always be problem that will arise, but there will always be someone who can fix the problem. We should be able to own our own driverless cars by the year 2020.",0

Right now this may be unavailable however Google, and many car manufacturers have been working very had to bring this to reality. All the current ""driverless cars"" have INE major problem and that being we need a human to respond to situations that the car cannot.",0
"Google has developed a LIDAR a spinning sensor on the roof of the car which is constantly updating 3-d models of the cars surroundings. They have also made it possible to respond to danger and out-of-control skids or rollovers. With both of these technologies it makes it possible to have a driverless car. We may need a humans help still, but using various methods such as a vibrating seat or income system we can quickly alert the driver that we need them to take over.",0
"Driverless cars are great, but like all great things there are some problems. The biggest problem is if a driverless car gets into a wreck whose problem is it the manufacturer or the driver.

"I support this idea and here is why I do. This will show very high improvement in classrooms, as this it will show how a kid can learn, if they are happy about this subject and if they are highly entertained, or this could go another way of teaching say we didn't have this type technology. A math teacher gives there students a test, the average over all is a 72%, that is not good, a teacher will have to go over the subject again majority due to failing of the subject. Was it the teacher, or was it the students, who will ever know, but if they had the technology in the room to read their facial expressions, for that the teacher may have postponed the test due to the results of the facial expressions coming back, which could have showed a lot of confusion over the section. That could have saved a lot of time and get better grades, as they could have not gone back over the section. This would show a lot of improvement in testing scores over all, as teacher would not mine going back over an answer if a student or students or confused what is going.",0

"If we had this in a classroom, this would help so much, schools could see higher test scores and better improvements. I think it would even better if they took this to even more places. Such as Jails, Conceding areas, Therapists, as it could show in their true emotions, this could be a lie sector, shows the emotions. Say they can't get anything from someone in a jail, they use that, they could see a fear emotion, or a blank emotion, or sad emotion. I just say this could change the future of a lot things in everyday life. This could also mean that, school corporations might receive rewards for really high scores in testing, which could really help out and some schools, for instance my school, we have don't have some of the newest technology as some other schools due, and why because I go to a small school, so we don't receive high standards as other schools around us do. So that is why I agree we should have this newest technology and a lot of the schools, to succeed in life and to help kids get better.",0

"In the article ""Making Mona Lisa Smile"", the author describes how a new technology called the Facial Action Coding System (or FACS) enables computers to identify human emotions. In the paragraph below I will be explaining why I believe the technology presented in this article would be valuable by reading the emotional expressions of students in a classroom.",0
"First, I believe that the use of this technology is valuable to be used for reading the emotional expressions of students in a classroom because like the article states it could, if used correctly, determine when a student is becoming ""confused or bored"". This could lead to modified lessons that engage and more effectively teach students the material without the need for so much individual attention from the teacher.",0
"Also, connecting to my last statement this technology may not only aid in the students learning but also provide help to teachers. This is because with technology that can read the students emotions and possibly adapt lessons to the individual the teacher in the room won't have to worry about giving all the students their own individual attention to help them most effectively learn the same material with only a small amount of time to do it. This technology would almost be like having a dozen or so assistant teachers in the room leaving more time for the real teacher to attend to things like making lesson plans and grading.",0
"Last but not least I feel that this technology would be useful in the classroom is because if a child was sad, hurting, depressed, or any other negative emotion and the student was hiding all that through a smile the technology may be able to help see behind the smile so that teachers or therapists can better help students through their problems and understand them better without spending so much time reading a children confusing signals.",0
"In conclusion, I believe that the Facial Action Coding System can be a valuable tool in the classroom for a variety of reasons including but not limited to the reasons I described in the above paragraphs.",0
"Have you ever ask yourself why do some people are always are their home never go out to socialize with others?

"In my opinion I think technology has positive effect in people's live specially in young people, because teens who are in school have more opportunities to learn a get the skills that they need for their future, they have access to computers at their school to get more information about their classwork and the benefit to take classes or tests online without even attending to school.",0
"Technology allows you to communicate with others without having contact, you don't need to be face to communicate with others, it brings people the facilities for those who don't have time to go out to buy the things that they need online like clothes or grocery without going to the store, and the capability to invent things that humans can't do.",0
"However, technology has negatives effects too, have you ever seen a little kid playing with toys like before technology was invented, you can see kids of 5-10 years old that already have a phone or video game console, they are addicted to it but not only kids young people too, therefore people can lose their vision by using it too much but it's not the fault of technology it's our own responsibility to take care of our health.",0
Technology affects peoples life by reducing their contact with others but at the same time it brings a lot of benefits to our generation and the future.,0
"Dear Principal,",0
"I think that your first policy is a very good idea, and you should go with that idea. Your second policy would just make the students very angry and make them start hating you, and I'm pretty sure you don't want your students to hate you. I think that it is important for you to chose your first policy because if students didn't bring a cell phone to class, and they missed the bus they would have no way of calling their parents to come pick them up and about 90% of the students don't like to go in the office and call their parents they would rather use their cell phone, another reason why your first policy is good is because your students won't hate you, and they will have their phone, but they will have it turned off in class and be more focused on what the teacher is teaching, and also if you took away cell phones you would have a lot of students who hate you and refuse to pay attention in class.",0
"Missing the bus is a very average thing, at least five people a day miss the bus every day and most of those people who miss the bus don't like to go in the office and call from that phone because they are either scared you will get mad at them for missing the bus or that there will be another person there that will think them stupid for missing the bus. Most students don't have perfect grades and so some stay after school and miss their bus and calling their parents from their cell phone is a very casual thing because as soon as they get done with what they were doing in that class they can call their parents to pick them up, so they get home faster. Students also like to call their parents from their cell phones to see if they can go to their friends house and that's just a faster way of calling instead of going to the office and waiting because then the friend and the person have just missed their bus. So keep the cell phones and you won't have to worry bout anyone missing their bus or too scared to come in and call from the office phone.",0
"Your first policy states that we can have our cell phones if we only use it during lunch or our free time which is a great idea because then you will have your students focused during class and trying to have fun in that class so that they have the time fly buy and be able to text during their free time. If you take away our phones because you got us texting class, that is ok because that is totally fair because we shouldn't have ever been texting in class in the first place. So let us keep our phones, and we promise not to text in class and pay attention and to only text during our free time.",0
"Taking away our cell phones like is says to do in your second policy is a very bad idea because you will have 100% of the students hating you and a principal that has all of its students that hates them makes the school go into chaos. What I mean by that is that none of the teachers will have students willing to participate and do their work which means a lot of kids failing just because you decided to take away cell phones from the school, and I'm pretty sure you don't want to run a school with a bunch of failing kids and more to come if you take away our cell phones.",0
"So stick with your first policy and keep cell phones, and we promise not to text during class and only during our free time. Going with your second policy would be a terrible thing because then you would have a bunch of students not will to participate and not having a ride home because they missed the bus and not to mention every student will hate you. So make the smart choice and keep a war off of your hands and go with your first policy.  ",0
"Working with a group on school assignments can be beneficial for students, as it can help them learn new skills, find solutions to problems, and break down complicated concepts. On the other hand, working alone can have its own advantages, such as allowing students to work at their own pace and ensuring that they get full credit for their work. ",1
"Ultimately, both approaches have their pros and cons, and students should decide which approach works best for them. In particular, working with a group can be a great choice for students because it allows for collaboration and shared responsibility among team members. Not only can this make the project more manageable and enjoyable, but it can also help foster teamwork and problem-solving skills essential for success in the future. Moreover, working with a group can also give students access to a greater range of perspectives, allowing each member to learn from one another’s ideas and abilities. For these reasons, students should consider voting to work in a group on school assignments.",1
"Summer projects are one of the most common forms of ensuring that students continue learning during their long summer break. These projects allow students to keep the information and experience that they learned through their school year throughout the summer. However, though the purpose and need of the summer projects may be valid, they are not interesting and motivating projects for students to complete, and, as such, students tend to procrastinate in completing their projects and learn less from the project thereby defeating its very purpose. The result of such a summer project, is the loss of knowledge gained by students in the past year, bad grades at the start of the new school year, and the unpreparedness of the students to return to school in a higher level class. Due to the fact that teachers are adults who prioritize the implement of knowledge into students, they are, at times, unable to make the summer projects they assign motivating to the students thereby resulting in this kind of summer projects. Summer projects should be student-designed because it will prevent the procrastination of students on the projects, allow students to absorb more from the project itself, and make the summer project more appealing for the students to complete.",0
"One of the most important reasons why summer projects must be designed by students is to prevent the procrastination of students in the completion of said project. Due to the fact that summer projects tend to be rigorous and tiring, students tend to avoid completing the project until the very last second, which can result in a poor project, the students being unable to recall the learnings of their past year, and even causing them to be unprepared for the challenges of a higher level course. However, if the summer projects were student-designed, they would make it interesting for other students while including the necessary content under teacher supervision. By doing so, students who have to complete the assignment would be more motivated and interested in completing the summer project and would, therefore, not wait till the last second. Due to the last minute efforts by the students, students may feel the need to copy another person's summer project in order to simply make the deadline that they had forgotten about. This cheating would only lead to the students learning nothing from the project, being unprepared for their new higher level class, and learning to cheat on school work. To mitigate or prevent that situation, summer projects should be student-designed, so students would avoid their procrastination all together. Summer projects should be student-designed in order to prevent the procrastination of students thereby allowing them to fulfill the purpose of their summer project.",0
"Though preventing the procrastination of students on the project is indeed one of the greatest benefits of having summer projects being student-designed, another key benefit of this is for it to allow students to absorb and learn more from the project. Due to the fact that summer projects can be tiring and complicated, students tend to absorb little from their completion besides what they must already know. This leads to students being unprepared for their new classes and also deprived of knowledge that was just before their eyes. By having student-designed summer projects, which will be more appealing to the students, students will try harder and be more invested in their projects, therefore allowing them to gain more from their projects than what they normally would. On normal summer projects, students tend to fill out the project without actually understanding what they're doing. By having student-designed summer projects, students are more interested in the project and due to that fact, they are more likely to understand more about the concepts behind the project itself. Summer projects should be designed by students in that it will allow students to learn more from the summer projects than what they normally would.",0
"Preventing the procrastination of students in the summer and allowing them to learn more from the summer projects are both important benefits of having student-designed summer projects, however, none of those benefits would even be possible without the fact that student-designed summer projects are much more invigorating to complete than a normal summer project to a student. Students have the unique advantage of understanding what students like and dislike which gives them an enormous advantage when it comes to creating a summer project for other students. This advantage is why more students will be interested in completing their summer projects which lead to them not procrastinating and absorbing more knowledge from the project. Student-designed summer projects will be naturally be more appealing to students because it would be designed to inspire their interests and therefore their concentration and focus.",0
"Summer projects are a way for students to learn and develop even in the summer when there is no school for them to attend. Therefore, these projects are an important part of a student's school year because their purpose is to allow students to keep the information and experience that they have learned through their school year throughout the summer and to prepare them for their next year. However, even though these projects are needed and are useful to many students, are they currently effective in achieving their purpose? In order to achieve their purpose of cultivating students, summer projects should be student-designed because by having students design the projects, it can prevent student procrastination on these projects, allow students to gain more knowledge and understanding from these projects, and also motivate students to complete these projects. By appealing to student's interests and creativity, allowing students to learn more, and preventing their procrastination; to help future students, summer projects should be student-designed.",0
"Dear Principal,",0
"I believe you should ban cell phones at school. There is no logical need for them, other than giving your buddy a quick answer on a difficult test or texting a false rumor to your friend. Cell phones on campus may give students an easy way to contact their parent/guardian in case of an emergency, which is a definite pro, but it also brings in a whole load of cons that I believe outweigh this small pro by a long-shot.",0
"Allowing students to bring phones, but not allowing them to use them during class is somewhat a dumb idea. The temptation would be right there for them, literally in the palm of their hand. It would be quite simple to give an answer to a friend who happens to be struggling on a certain test. I am quite certain that choosing that policy will result in multiple incidents in where students will have their cell phones taken away, possibly for good.",0
"Rumors are not a very kind thing. They can hurt someone, or might even be false, which could hurt somebody even more. Text messaging is used now by our generation more and more. It is now even being used more than phone calls. Allowing phones on campus just perpetuates the idea of spreading rumors. It would be simple and easy to just text message the latest rumor to your friend, who in turn might spread this juicy gossip to his or her other friends. Soon the rumor has spread all throughout the campus, most likely garbled and distorted into something completely different, possibly even false. If a student just has to tell something to another student, can't they just talk to them in person? Might it be somewhat easier to just catch your friend in the hall and speak to them? This way students would not be able to spread these dark rumors around, without looking conspicuous, that is.",0
"Having a policy like, so I believe will better the school greatly. The campus will be more friendly, more open, and more civilized than other campuses who use cell phones.",0
Please take all of these suggestions into serious consideration.,0

"In recent years, there has been a growing movement to limit car usage. This is due to a number of factors, including the environmental impact of cars, the cost of owning and operating a car, and the health risks associated with driving.",1
"One of the most important reasons to limit car usage is the environmental impact of cars. Cars produce a significant amount of pollution, including greenhouse gases, which contribute to climate change. Cars also produce air pollutants, which can cause respiratory problems and other health issues. In addition, the construction and maintenance of roads and highways requires the use of non-renewable resources, such as oil and concrete.",1
"Another reason to limit car usage is the cost of owning and operating a car. Cars are expensive to purchase, insure, and maintain. They also require parking, which can be costly in urban areas. In addition, the cost of gasoline has been rising steadily in recent years.",1
"Finally, there are health risks associated with driving. Drivers are at risk of accidents, which can result in serious injuries or death. Drivers are also exposed to air pollutants, which can cause respiratory problems and other health issues.",1
"There are a number of things that can be done to limit car usage. One option is to walk or bike instead of driving. This is a healthy and environmentally friendly way to get around. Another option is to take public transportation. This is a convenient and affordable way to travel, and it helps to reduce traffic congestion. Finally, it is possible to carpool or use ride-sharing services. This can help to reduce the number of cars on the road and save money on gas.",1
"Limiting car usage has a number of benefits. It can reduce pollution, save money, and improve health. It can also make communities more livable by reducing traffic congestion and providing more space for people to walk, bike, and socialize. If we all make an effort to limit car usage, we can make a big difference for the environment and our own health.",1
"In conclusion, there are a number of reasons to limit car usage. Car usage has a negative impact on the environment, it is expensive, and it can be dangerous. There are a number of things that we can do to limit car usage, such as walking, biking, taking public transportation, carpooling, or using ride-sharing services. Limiting car usage has a number of benefits, including reducing pollution, saving money, and improving health. If we all make an effort to limit car usage, we can make a big difference for the environment and our own health.",1
There are many reasons why older people enjoy life more than young people. One reason is that young people are still developing and are still learning about the world around them. They are also still learning about themselves and how to find their place in the world. Older people are more experienced and can provide a more complete view of the world. They can also provide support to young people as they grow and learn.,1
"Another reason why older people enjoy life more is that they have had more experience in the world. They have been through more life experiences and can provide a more complete view of the world. They can also provide support to young people as they grow and learn. Older people also have more memories to share with others. They can share memories of their childhood, their family, their friends, or their life in general. This can provide a more complete view of the world for others.",1
"In the article ""driverless cars are coming,"" the author presents both positive and negative aspects of driverless cars. I think that there should be driverless cars in the future. The idea of driverless cars is great, and can help save many lives.",0
"Right now without driverless cars there are becoming way to many accidents. More and more people are getting tickets by speeding and or texting while driving. With driverless cars, their will be a lot less accidents when texting. Also since the car is driving for you, it will go the right speed limit. Driverless cars still need some work, but in a couple of years it will be fixed. Each generation is becoming smarter and smarter. So if we have started to make the hard part of the driverless car, imagine what we will be able to do in a couple of years! Driverless cars can also help with traffic. Driverless cars will discover the fastest way possible to get to the drivers' location. The driver will not have to worry about as much. The car takes care of that for them!",0
"Driverless cars can help people from getting injured and making people less stressed. It is a great way for people to get less tickets. It will help the flow of traffic and find the shortest was possible to get to their location. With newer technology these next couple years, we will be able to make the driverless car safe and fun where everybody will love them.",0
Dear principal. I think policy #1 is the best policy for the school because us teenagers like to be on the phone to talk to friends or relatives and during lunch all were doing is having free time anyway were talking to are friends and eating so I don't know why it should be a big deal on not letting us use are cell phones at lunchtime and for free time in class you should allow us to use are phones because were just having free time were not learning anything new but during class time are phones should be off like you said because its class time not lunchtime or free time. That's why I think policy 1 is the best thing. But see you teachers can be on the phone at any time you want so that's why I say let us be on are phones at lunch or during free time because we like to talk to are friends cousins if they don't go to the same school we do and all were doing is texting or calling I don't see why that should be a big deal. So once again that's why I say policy 1 is the best policy for the school.,0
"Dear, State Senator",0
"I would like to inform you of the elections to the electoral college and the by popular votes, that this is to the fact we should change by the popular votes for the president instead of the Electoral College because under the Electoral college system voters would not be able to vote not for the president but for the slate of electors, the state legislatures are being responsible for picking the electors so the can vote for the people and the college is unfair, outdated,and irrational.",0
"Although being that voters will not be able to vote for the president. The voters may be able to vote but not for the president but for a slat EOF electors, who in turn elect the president. These would go to congress and the vote for the electoral votes this makes it much worse to consider the state legislatures are technically.",0
The electors have occasionally refused to vote for their party candidate and cast of deciding the site whomever they would like to have it given an amount of voters to vote for one party for the president and another for the congress. They picked more electoral votes responsible for picking the electors could always defy the will of the people.,0
"This is unfair, outdated and irrational because its in favor of mostly assertions without much basic of not letting the people vote instead of the state legislature choosing electors to vote to pick the president.  ",0
"State Senator,",0
"The Electoral College is not a fair way to vote. Instead of voting for whom you would like to win, you are voting for an elector who says they will vote for the candidate you want to win. Voting for whom we want is a part of our rights! The Electoral College system is not only out dated, but there have also been a few fiascos.",0
"This style of voting has been going on since the beginning, there are many flaws that need to be worked on. A major problem would be the electors; they are not reliable. ""Can voters control whom their electors vote for? Not always."" This right here proves that the electors don't always tell the truth. Who picks the electors anyway? ""Sometimes state conventions, sometimes the state party's central committee, sometimes the presidential candidates themselves."" We don't even get to select our electors, how are we supposed to rely on strangers to vote for whom we would like? Would you trust a random stranger to take care of your child? It is the same as putting the fate of our country in the hands of someone some people have never even seen! ""During the 2000 campaign, seventeen states didn't see the candidates at all,"" This information should prove to you that the Electoral College is unfair.",0
"The disaster factor should have been the end to the Electoral College. ""Segregationists in the Louisiana legislature nearly succeeded in replacing the Democratic electors with new electors who would oppose John F. Kennedy."" Is there anything left to say? These people tried to sabotage the election. What is stopping more people from this? Some electors refused to vote for whom they said they would. ""'faithless' electors have occasionally refused to vote for their party's candidate and cast a deciding vote for whomever they please."" In 1960 Hawaii sent two slates of electors to Congress! Thanks goodness for Vice President Nixon who ""validated only his opponent's electors, but made sure to do so 'without establishing a precedent.'""",0
"Also, many people stated that they prefer the direct election, ""Over 60 percent of voters would prefer a direct election to the kind we have now."" With giving you this information, you should be able to infer that the Electoral College should be changed.",0
"In conclusion, more people are against the Electoral College than with it. We should be able to vote for which one we prefer. Fewer people would have a problem with the election process, and it would go a lot smoother.",0
"Thank you for your time,",0

"Owning a vehicle or absence is not what it used to be. Today, people all across the globe have given up driving for the many benefits that come along with alternative methods of transportation. These methods can reduce pollution, be cost-effective, and even improve people's well-being and happiness.",0
"First, there is a surprising amount of options if you don't want to drive a car.",0
"Public transportation such as trains and buses exist in most major cities, especially in America and Europe. San Francisco is a busy city with many young residents, and many of these residents are not interested in getting their licenses. "". . . They organize their summer jobs and social life around where they can walk or take public transportation or car-pool with friends."" Because so many options exists, many people don't feel the need to own a car anymore. Similarly, some cities and towns have been made specifically to be navigated by foot, like Vauban Germany. Towns like Vauban are tailored to fit its resident's needs in everyday. "". . . In this new approach, stores are placed a walkaway, on a main street, rather than in malls along some distant highway."" In Vauban, necessities are conveniently placed so that the town's inhabitants may access them with ease, rather than driving around the town.",0
"However, alternative transportation methods are not the only reason to give up your car. By not driving a car, air pollution can be decreased drastically. In Paris, France's largest city and international destination, driving was temporarily illegal because of heavy smog in the city. "". . . Congestion was down 60 percent in the capital of France, after five-days of intensifying smog."" It did not take very long for traffic and smog to clear up once the ban was put in place, and the famous city began to look like itself once again.",0
"People are also happier when they do not drive cars. ' ""When I had a car I was always tense. I'm much happier this way,"" said Hadron Walter.'  ",0
"In today's fast-paced world, young people are often accused of not giving enough time to helping their communities. While it is true that many young people are busy with school, work, and other activities, I believe that they still contribute significantly to their communities. In this essay, I will argue that young people do indeed give enough time to helping their communities, and I will provide several reasons and examples to support my position.",1
"Firstly, young people are often involved in community service projects and volunteer work. Many high schools and colleges require students to complete a certain number of community service hours in order to graduate. This means that young people are actively seeking out opportunities to help their communities. For example, I have personally volunteered at a local food bank and helped to organize a charity event for a children's hospital. These experiences have taught me the importance of giving back to my community and have inspired me to continue doing so in the future.",1
"Secondly, young people are often at the forefront of social and political movements that aim to improve their communities. For example, the Black Lives Matter movement was largely led by young people who were passionate about addressing systemic racism and police brutality. Similarly, young people have been instrumental in advocating for environmental protections and climate change action. These movements demonstrate that young people are not only willing to give their time, but also their energy and passion, to make a difference in their communities.",1
"Finally, young people are often creative and innovative in their approaches to community service. For example, many young people have started their own non-profit organizations or social enterprises that aim to address specific issues in their communities. These organizations often use social media and other digital platforms to reach a wider audience and engage more people in their work. Additionally, young people are often more willing to experiment with new ideas and approaches to community service, which can lead to more effective and impactful solutions.",1
"In conclusion, while it is true that young people are often busy with school, work, and other activities, I believe that they still give enough time to helping their communities. Young people are often involved in community service projects and volunteer work, at the forefront of social and political movements, and creative and innovative in their approaches to community service. These contributions demonstrate that young people are not only capable of making a difference in their communities, but also willing and eager to do so.",1
"The idea of a four-day school week has been met with both praise and scrutiny. Proponents argue that it would offer a much-needed reprieve for students, families, and teachers alike. Research suggests that students could benefit from reduced stress brought about by eliminating the school week entirely on Fridays. In addition, parental involvement could increase, as families could use Friday as a day for enrichment activities with their children. ",1
"On the other hand, disadvantages to a four-day school week could include longer school days for students and a more complex schedule for teachers. In addition, student-family relationships could be strained due to longer hours away from home and an increased academic workload. Furthermore, students may find it difficult to maintain their focus for a longer school day or to stay motivated over a longer school week.",1
"The potential effects of a four-day school week should be considered carefully before deciding whether to move forward with such a change. The potential advantages and disadvantages should be thoroughly evaluated to create an equitable outcome that addresses the needs of students, families and teachers alike.",1
"So just because i couldn't open the exhibit window am I going to write about what do you I like to do in class. I like to work alone with nobody bother me. sometimes I like to with work with groups but is all depend on what type of people am I working with and also how is my mood during the day of in the class. When am I working like to listen to music because it let me focus what am I doing and i don't get distracted with the others' student talking about drama or what is going on and there life or school. Also, when am in class i don't like when teachers or student start asking me question where I am from or what do I like to do. Or sometimes I like to work when the place is quiet because I can focus more and the place is quiet I can do my work in peaces. Also, I like to have my personal bubble because i don't like when teacher or student come to my face and start asking me about stuff that I do not know or when they give me an attitude so that is the time when the situation will star to get worse because every time when to happen I will do the same to do them but mine it will be worse and sometimes I cannot control myself. When the work in a group I like to work with people that won't talk too much, and we do our own work. Because when I work in group who talk a lot I cannot focus on my work, or they are just talking stupid stuff and trying to be funny there is when I get mad or when they're trying to put me in there conversion that I do not care because if I am not talking to you or to the group that mean I am good and I do not need you or i don't need your opinion. I like to be my own personality because I know what I am doing and I am doing because I like it and when people told to stuff or me trying to be a different person just because they don't how I am or that way I dress or look. And I cannot be an other type of person who I am not because I will be lying to myself and lying to the people around me just because I am acting different or look different for other people to think I am like that. Also, if you think we are friends, and you start to get conferees around me, and you start talking about your life I am just going to walk away because i didn't ask you about your life because I am not interested in your life because if I did, i probably would ask you but if i didn't ask that mean i really don't care what do you do or what do you like. If i don't like you, you better understand i won't be nice to you and i won't try to have a conversation with you. Or event class if I am not talking with anyone the mean i don't want y'all to talk to me or if i don't like the teacher I just keep my distance but if the teacher i don't like and she/he come at know where a start yelling at me, i won't stay quiet and I will say stuff back to you because you just come to my face a start yelling at me for no reason so that is telling me that you got a problem with me and i didn't know at about it. It is so ease if you respect me I will respect you back because if you come at mo where a start saying stuff to me and i really don't know what is going on I swear will disrespect you and say a lot of stuff to you because you came to me saying stuff and every time that happen i really don't care if I hurt you or I hurt your feeling. If you leave me alone we probably we be cool and we won't have any issues with each other. Been around people is not my type stuff I like to do i just rather to be alone and do my own stuff but if you need help would ask someone who I think they know just go to the internet and try to found what I need online. Because i don't like to bother people just to do it or try my best to guess in the answer.",0
"Changing our school men to much healthier choice's is a good idea because it's good for the students to eat much healthier food in school. Eating more fresh fruits and water can help students focus and not fall asleep in class. Eating junk food could make you tired, and you won't have the energy to do anything. It's better to take away the opinion of getting junk food that the cafeteria puts out for students. Students won't be so tempted to eat it, and could choose a better and healthier choice.",0
"Most students want to stay in shape, so they try to eat healthier. Adding healthier choices in TH school cafeteria men could help them stay in shape. Most students don't work out, so they depend on the food they eat. Some students tend to buy food and then throw it out because of how the food is made. The school could make a scald bar for those who chose to eat it, and they could add their own toppings, so they could eat something they like instead of throwing it out.",0
"I think having fruits smoothies, organic bake goods, and a salad bar could be very good for every school to have because the school could make a lot of money selling this at school and it's healthy for students to eat and enjoy. Most students won't have to get Uber eats to get food that they like if the school sold smoothies or bake goods. And staff members that get lunch from the cafeteria could enjoy having a healthier lunch.",0
"In conclusion changing the schools cafeterias men to much healthier choice would be good for students and staff members, so they could stay healthy and focus.",0
Have people ever wanted to know if seeking out multiple opinions or getting more advice will help them get a better answer?,0
Well today is that day.,0
I will be doing research to see if asking for more advice and multiple opinions is better.,0
In my opinion I think it is.,0
These are a few reasons I think asking people for more advice can help.,0
"When asking for advice people get a more broad look at what there is, it might change peoples ideas for the better, and if you get more advice from people, you can see the outcomes of what they did.",0
"Firstly, when asking for advice people get a more broad look at what there is.",0
If people want to see what other choices they can make they can ask others.,0
Most of the time the person people ask will likely have chosen a different path than another person.,0
Which means that there is a higher chance of people getting multiple opinions by everyone.,0
People will most likely have a better choice if they ask more people for help them.,0
When people ask for more advice it is always better for them.,0
Out of 10 people that ask for more advice 9 of them will have a better outcome than the people that didn't ask for more than 1 opinion.,0
When I get a broad look on something I normally have a few better choices that I will make.,0
"Secondly, it might change people ideas for the better.",0
If people are ever questioning if the choice they are going to make is bad then they should ask for advice.,0
"Because, when people hear advice from somebody else it could change their whole perspective about the choice they were going to make.",0
When people hear advice or multiple opinions there is a higher percentage of them being more successful than others that don't ask.,0
Asking for more advice is always helpful because it can help people choose a better job or a better car.,0
"Lastly, if you get more advice from people, you can see the outcomes of what they did.",0
By seeing the outcomes of what they did people can see if the outcome is positive or negative.,0
If it is positive people should probably take this advice and learn form it to make better divisions or make a good choice.,0
If the outcome is negative don't take this advice because it might lead people down the wrong path.,0
If someone finds two people with two good opinions and they don't know what to choose they should choose the one that fits them the best.,0
If they don't find one that is good for them then they should go with what fits them the best.,0
When seeking multiple opinions and asking for advice to make better choices people should always make sure they find advice that fits them best.,0
People should always do this just so they have a better outcome.,0
These are a few reasons I think asking people for more advice can help.,0
"When asking for advice people get a more broad look at what there is, it might change peoples ideas for the better, and if you get more advice from people, you can see the outcomes of what they did.",0
People should always have a better outcome when they ask for advice.,0
There are more ideas on why asking for advice is good but the ones I stated are the best ones.,0
"One big thing I want to happen is that the electoral college for voting should be changed for popular vote for the president because I think that if you change it voting would go a lot easier than it do now. Why? Because the electoral college is a more complicated voting matter that people often do and get their votes mixed up, and it takes more effort and time just to vote rather than an easy popular vote that people can measure off a chart or graph to see with person should get elected.",0
"Another thing about the voting process I think i should'd talk about is some possible problems you can come across after this change in the voting process. There's one thing that's possible of happening is that a lot of people might nor agree with changing the voting process because they don't want to learn a new one because they are so used to the one they're already doing. Another one is that people might think things would go worse if someone mad a change because they way the votes are coming in and if you're voting on a behalf of a friend and send the vote to the wrong person and the other person lost by 1 vote when you didn't mean to send that, they should have a computer system that you use that makes sure you really want to vote on that person.",0
It is another major thing about voting that needs to be discussed. When all these thousands of people vote they vote should actually count not just have people vote and then the only votes that count is the people in some courtroom that have more business people come in to vote and only there's count. But I think people waist a lot of their time with the electoral college because of how it works and the way people send their votes and who the votes actually going to.,0
"The winner of the election is the most important one because he is the main focus now because his votes were more popular of just a lot more than the other person, but that's what I want to talk about. Even though the winner won he still has to pay attention to the other candidates, but they should have a system that protects the winner files and have people haves a good watch on the people who are elected to see what their background life is like their history and what they do every day to make sure that person isn't trying no horrible plan for something.

"I think we should have computers that read emotions, so it could keep us on track and make students want to learn and help us focus on our work ironclads room it's a good thing to technology.",0
"A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored,"" Dr. Huang predicts. Then it could modify the lesson, like an effective human instructor."" the same technology can make computer - animated faces more expressive. This would make students want to learn more because sometimes students get bored looking at the same thing on a computer for long periods of time but if there was a computer that reads your emotions and could fix how we learn it would make us want to learn more and keep us from not being bored while on the computer you will want to get your work done and not want to go to sleep in class.",0
Positive Attitude During Difficult Times,1
"In life, we all face difficult times. Whether it's a breakup, a failure, or a health issue, these moments can be challenging and overwhelming. However, during these times, it's important to maintain a positive attitude. In this essay, I will explore the effects of having a positive attitude during a difficult time, as well as ways to support a loved one going through a difficult time, and a personal narrative of a loved one who maintained a positive attitude during a difficult time.",1
"Firstly, research shows that having a positive attitude during a difficult time can have a significant impact on an individual's mental and physical health. According to a study by the Mayo Clinic, people who have a positive attitude tend to have better overall health and are less likely to experience chronic diseases such as heart disease and cancer. Additionally, having a positive attitude can help individuals cope with stress and anxiety, which can lead to better mental health.",1
"Secondly, there are many ways to support a loved one going through a difficult time. One way is to simply be there for them and listen to their concerns. Another way is to offer practical help, such as running errands or cooking a meal. It's also important to be empathetic and understanding, and to avoid judgment or criticism.",1
"Lastly, I have a personal narrative of a loved one who maintained a positive attitude during a difficult time. My grandmother was diagnosed with cancer a few years ago, and it was a very difficult time for our family. Despite the news, my grandmother remained positive and optimistic throughout her treatment. She would often say that she was grateful for the love and support of her family and friends, and that she was going to fight the cancer with all her might. Her positive attitude not only inspired us all, but it also helped her cope with the pain and discomfort of her treatment.",1
"In conclusion, having a positive attitude during a difficult time is important for both our mental and physical health. There are many ways to support a loved one going through a difficult time, including simply being there for them and offering practical help. Finally, maintaining a positive attitude can have a significant impact on the way we approach difficult situations, and can inspire those around us.",1
Unmasking The Face,0
"A lot of people lately have been suspicious of my company NASA. While I don't agree with them, I do see their side. The public has all reasons to be suspicious towards the ""Face of Mars!"" Sounds like something from ""The Twilight Zone."" Well, Mars, though so barren, might as well been considered the earth's twin sister... or brother. The two planet's surfaces have shown some interesting similarities, like water remnants and climates. Not to mention volcanoes. This is where we find the reason behind the face of Mars!",0
"On our planet earth, we have land structures called ""Mesas."" These elevated lands are found in the ""American West"", where the surrounding deserts (used to be oceans in theory), are now filled with canyons, rock flats, salt flats, mesas, and other forms only found there. Mars might as well have a northwest region where one could find earthlike similarities. This may as well be the reason behind the face. Also, one should note that the shadows may be rocks making a shadow from the sunlight. Another logical explanation to look at France. Shaped like a boot, it is just a landform that naturally occurred, looking like something we know.",0
"My company would also like to state that this really ""isn't"" a cover-up. In true fact, the discovery of other life or remnants of one such time would be positive to us, and to our projects. So, say what you want. Believe in what you think, but we at NASA believe this isn't alien. Just another similarity between Mars and Earth.",0

"We students have been hearing stories of you taking away sports unless we have a B average. I personally think it is a plausible idea, it will be a great way to pick up the student's grades and test scores. It also will encourage students into putting effort in their work. It shall help the school look better too.",0
"Furthermore, it is a great idea it will further some students academically it should give students's who need to help more time to focus on their work. The students might study more so that they can pick their scores up to be one of the students playing and not having to worry about grades because they have it in the bag.",0
"It will encourage students to put more effort into their work. If students see that all they need is to push a little more, and they will make it, most of them will. If I was not making good grades by a mere couple points i would just try a little harder to at least say I tried. It is even better when you can say"" I made it"". Students don't like being stuck in classrooms all day, so they will do anything to get out even working. If the only way to get out of class is to work it will be the fastest time you ever so a student strive and put effort in their work.",0
It will make the school look better. Once your counties superintendent an board of directors gets together and review the school it would get outstanding recognition. That is always good to have.,0
This is an overall good idea Say you should go For i,0
"One's character traits are often strongly influenced by the people we communicate with and the environment in which we live. For example, growing up I had a close friend who was very outgoing and adventurous. Spending time with them often pushed me out of my comfort zone and encouraged me to take on new challenges. Over time, I developed a strong sense of confidence and an inclination towards taking risks, traits that I would not have had access to without my friend's influence. Similarly, if a person is raised in an environment where creativity is actively encouraged and supported, they are more likely to be inventive and curious throughout their life. ",1
"To illustrate this point, one of my relatives grew up in an environment where she was surrounded by art, music, and books. At a young age her parents exposed her to various forms of creative expression and provided her with the necessary resources and tools to be creative. As a result, she grew up to be very artistic and proficient in multiple instruments. This would have not been the case had she not been exposed to the various forms of art and creativity in her childhood. ",1
"Overall, it is clear that one's character traits are often heavily influenced and formed by the people we communicate with and the environments in which we live. Through careful consideration and exploration of these external factors, a person can cultivate an abundance of positive traits and become their best possible self.",1
"Broad knowledge of many academic subjects is better than specializing in one specific subject. For one, it allows you to cover a greater range of topics and to develop a more complete understanding of them. Additionally, by having a broad knowledge of many academic subjects, you can better prepare yourself for any academic situation, whether it is for college or professional purposes.",1
"For example, if you are interested in studying law, you would be better off studying law history, law theory, and law practice. If you are interested in studying music, you would be better off studying music theory, music history, and music practice. By having a broad knowledge of many academic subjects, you can better prepare yourself for any academic situation.",1

"Technology is pretty cool and all, but it's not all rainbows and butterflies. In fact, there are some pretty negative impacts of technology that we should talk about. Now, I know some people might say that technology is awesome and has made our lives way easier, but I'm here to tell you that it's not all good. Here are three main ways' technology has a negative impact on people:",1
"First off, technology can be super distracting. Like, have you seen how many notifications you get on your phone? It's like, every five seconds someone is messaging you or posting something on social media. And don't even get me started on video games. I mean, I love playing Fortnite as much as the next guy, but sometimes I feel like I'm stuck in front of the screen for hours on end. It's like, how are we supposed to focus on our schoolwork or anything else when we're constantly getting notifications? It's like, our brains are just wired to be distracted all the time. And that's not good.",1
"Second, technology can be awful for our health. Like, have you heard of blue light? It's the light that comes from screens, and it's supposed to be awful for your eyes. And it's not just your eyes, either. Studies have shown that using technology for too long can lead to obesity, sleep problems, and even depression. I mean, who wants to be stuck in front of a screen all day? Not me, that's for sure. And it's not just us, either. Our parents and grandparents are probably getting affected by technology too. I mean, have you seen how many older people are on their phones all the time? It's like, they're trying to stay connected with their grandkids, but it's not good for them in the long run.",1
"Lastly, technology can be super addictive. Like, I know I'm guilty of spending way too much time on my phone. And it's not just me. Studies have shown that people can get addicted to technology",1
"When people are faced with an important decision, it is wise to seek advice from more than one source. Getting different perspectives allows you to see an issue from multiple angles and take various factors into consideration. While any one person's advice may be limited or biased based on their own experiences, hearing from several people balances out those individual limitations. ",1
"Friends and family members can provide emotional support and understand you personally, but they may be too close to give fully objective advice. On the other hand, strangers you just met will not have preconceived notions about you and can evaluate a situation more impartially. By blending the warmth and closeness of loved ones with the fresh perspective of less involved outsiders, you gain a well-rounded view.  ",1
"Different people also have unique backgrounds, areas of expertise, and ways of thinking that allow them to notice or emphasize different aspects of a situation. What one person views as the top priority or constraint may not even occur to someone else. Considering diverse opinions ensures that important variables are not overlooked. For major decisions, it is better to have all the relevant information on the table rather than miss something obvious to others but invisible to our own subjective viewpoints.",1
"In addition, the opinions of multiple people give you a sense of the average or consensus view. An isolated comment that no one else shares is less reliable than an idea independently brought up by several individuals. Patterns and consistencies across many discussions paint a clearer overall picture. With many voices contributing to the dialogue, you end up with a sounder, more-tested conclusion than relying on the advice of just one source.",1
"In closing, seeking multiple opinions allows you to avoid being unduly swayed by any single influence and make choices based on a full understanding of the complex circumstances involved. The wider information net of pooling varied advice leads to wiser decision-making.",1
Participating in Adventure,1
"The Seagoing Cowboys program offered me experiences I will never forget. As a lifelong cowboy from Wyoming, my work routinely involved caring for cattle on the open range. While rewarding, it was also familiar. The opportunity to travel by ship to new destinations and try working livestock on ocean waves was truly unique.  ",1
"Getting to visit Australia and handle cattle in the stockyards down under was beyond anything I could have imagined doing as a cowboy. The country was beautiful yet foreign, and interacting with both cattle and people from another culture opened my eyes. I particularly enjoyed conquering the challenge of breaking in horses right on the coast, with crashing waves all around. The adrenaline push of performing familiar, yet risky tasks in such unfamiliar surroundings was exhilarating.",1
"Not only did I broaden my horizons through international travel, but I also learned so much about handling livestock in diverse environments. Cattle have distinct behaviors on land versus floating in pens aboard ships crossing oceans. Gaining that precious knowledge and ability to adapt my skills will surely help me as a cattleman for years to come. The program also allowed me to meet other motivated ""seagoing cowboys"" from all over the US and world, expanding my network in the industry. ",1
"If you treasure adventure, crave fascinating experiences beyond your daily routine, and want to strengthen your skills as an agricultural worker, then I highly recommend participating in the Seagoing Cowboys program. The memories and lessons I gained will stay with me forever, and I hope sharing my own participation will inspire others to seize this unique chance to ride the waves.",1
"Responsible. Technology. Clever. I think students would be benefit from being able to attend classes from their homes. Although, it shows how clever the students are, make them responsible, help to improve the country, and good for their health nevertheless, some students are not responsible sometimes, because they have not being responsible before, and some students will use the chance of being able to attend classes online in a good way. According to BBC News there are 85% of students prefer to attend the classes online than attend to school.",0
"To begin, attend classes online is better than attend the classes at school in many ways. One of the ways is, it helps to build a responsible personalty. For instance, by giving the lessons online students are responsible to attend to class, and take notes; especially when there is a certain time for the classes to begin, and end. This shows that, when the students grow up, and being employees they will be responsible to attend to their jobs at time. This will help to improve our country then it is now; this is new generation! Clearly, attend classes online have a lot of benefits for students, and the country.",0
"Furthermore, by attend classes online will show how clever the students are!",0
"Plus, it is good for their health as well; it makes their brains to be more active. For example, when students have homework to do, they keep thinking about how to do it. Imagine when students have classes at homes, and have homework, how good it is for their brains! This shows that, attend classes online at homes has many benefits for students; it not only shows how clever they are by take classes online, but it helps them to be healthy. Obviously, I would prefer to attend classes online than come to school.",0
"Overall, being able to attend classes online is better than coming to school in many ways. As I wrote the benefits of being able to attend classes online. I think by 2020 all the students will prefer to attend their classes online than come school. In conclusion, attend classes online help to improve the country, and it helps students to show how clever they are; plus, it helps them to be healthy.",0
"The future is coming, and it is coming IIN the shape of cars. Driverless cars have been a dream form long ago, and it might just now be coming true.",0
"Although some Popeye think that this is not Avery good idea there many advantages to driverless cars. These cars are safe, well tested, and very helpful.",0
"Some people will argue that the cars might malfunction and crash or not know if there is a work zone and I needs to go slower. Driverless cars are not fully driverless. Although these cars can steer, accelerate, and brake themselves there is still a driver. As it said in the article,"" all are designed to noisy the driver when the road ahead requires human skills."" This would be like if there was a work zone at this point the car would alert the driver and he/she would have to take over. In the article it states that the companies that arr making these cars have added a way of noticing the driver. Some forms of alerting the passenger is by, vibrating meets, announcing that he or she should be prepared, and flashlights on the window shield. They have even thought of using cameras to make sure the driver is paying attention.",0
"Also, these cars have not just recently came out of the factory and put on the streets. Google has been working on its driverless cars since 2009. According to the article, ""their cars have driven more than half a million miles without a crash. Yet, their car is not completely driverless, there is still a human that takes over pulling in and out of driveways or in complicated traffic issues. The thought of driverless cars has been here since the 1950s in the article it states that, 'in the late 1950s, General Motors created a concept car that could run on a special test track. The track was embedded with an electric cable that sent radio signals to a receiver on front end of the car. ' So then since the 1950s scientist and engineers have been working on and improving this concept of driverless cars. That is more than sixty years of research and work in order to make and some perfect these cars.",0
"After and when driverless cars are final perfected they will have many significant uses. For example, public transportation, everywhere you go there is public transportation, and it is a big need expressly in the big cities. In this passage it states that, the cars would use half of the full of today's taxis and offer far more flexibility than a bus."" This would change the world, if cars are diverless it would give the human a great advantage. Also from a fun perspective when people go on long road trips they can normal just drive for about eight hours before they need to rest. With driverless cars the car would do all the work posed to the driver.",0
"In conclusion driverless cars are coming and are a great thing. They will be safe for all users, provide great benefits, and have been well researched and worked on. They are a thing of the future, and we are final there. Driverless cars are a thing everyone should look forward fore.  ",0
Cell Phone Use While Driving,0
It has become a common practice today for many people to use their phones while driving. They try to be as efficient as possible with their time and see no problem with trying to multitask when operating a vehicle. Some text on their phones while others may take calls or check emails. In no regard is this a safe practice and drivers should not be allowed to use a phone under any circumstance as it only amount to a more dangerous driving environment.,0
"Often times crashes are the result of distracted driving. This usually occurs in teenage age groups who have a commitment to checking their phones while driving. Teenagers assume that by taking their eyes off of the road for solely two seconds, they aren't putting themselves or anyone else in danger. In reality, distracted driving via cell phone use ""reduces the amount of brain activity associated with driving by 37 percent,"" (""Cell Phones""). Taking calls or texting confidently reduces a driver's ability to control a vehicle, respond to driving events, and direct attention to the roadway. This isn't the case for just teenagers. These conditions apply to every driver who attempts to use their cell phone while driving, thus creating a dangerous driving environment. People often drive with family members, close friends, or children in the car. The chance of a fatal crash because of distracted driving is high, and it is very possible that these family members, close friends, and children could be injured or worse. It is much safer to restrict all phone use while driving in order to ensure that roadways remain safe. By not using a cell phone, a driver is better able to pay attention, less likely to crash, and following the law (""Cell Phones"").",0
"Many states have already offered consolation for the distracted driving problem in the United States. For instance, Georgia enacted Joshua's Law in 2007 requiring 16-year-old drivers to complete driver's ed. The state also recently approved the Hands-Free law, which in essence eliminated any and all distracted driving practices. States recognize the problems that come with cell phone use while driving and have taken steps to fix them. This is evidence enough that in no way, shape, or form should drivers be allowed to use cell phones while operating a vehicle. For further support, there are about 9 people killed and 1,000 injured daily in the United States because of distracted driving (""The Dangers of Distracted Driving""), thus the popularity of cell phone use while driving is a damaging practice in the U.S. and should be ended immediately. Although cell phones may be used beneficially while driving, such as GPS use, crime reporting, or roadside assistance, it is a more viable and safe practice to prohibit its use until a person it not behind the wheel of a vehicle. A person only puts themselves in more danger, even when doing something appropriate with a cellphone when operating a vehicle, by trying to utilize it and maintain focus on the road at the same time.",0
"In sum, it is in the most obvious interest of all drivers that cell phone use while driving be prohibited in any way or form. It is a dangerous practice that puts family, kids, and friends in immediate danger. Any benefits that are noted of cell phone use while driving are miniscule compared to the risk one takes by even looking at a phone for two seconds. Considering states have had enough common sense to begin a prohibition of the practice in favor of all drivers' safety, it is more than adequate to say that drivers should in no manner be given the opportunity to contribute a fatal driving environment by using a cell phone.",0

"If I was a scientist at NASA discussing the Face with someone who thinks it was created by aliens, because in the story it's said that '' Face on Mars'' has since become a pop icon. If I was a scientist in NASA I would found out how did the Peron face came to another planet. They have to get out the earth to come to another planet to just put your face on it out of nowhere. But if a person did put there face imprint on an another planet, I think they will turn into an alien. I will tell you why I said that, because people say that aliens are real, and they harm creatures. Also, if I'm the scientist this will tell that a FACE on a human body doing on an another planet they should be on earth. In the article its aids: twenty-five years ago something funny happening around Mars, NASA's Viking 1 spacecraft was circling the planet snapping photos of possible landing sites for its sister ship Viking 2. Also, when it spotted the shadowy likeness of a human face, an enormous head nearly two miles from end to end seemed to be staring back at the cameras from a region of the Red Planet called Colonia. There must have been a degree of surprise among mission controllers back at the Jet Propulsion Lab when the face appeared on the monitors. But now scientists figured it was just another Martian mesa common enough around Colonia only this one had unusual shadows that made it look like an Egyptian Pharaoh. But if I'm the scientist trying to figured out all this work, and see who's the human face or an alien face because humans on earth an alien in Mars or more planets. But afterwards after that happening, its aids how some people think the Face is bona fide evidence of life on Mars evidence that NASA would rather hide, say conspiracy theorists. Meanwhile, the defenders of the NASA budget wish there was an ancient civilization on Mars. Also, although few scientists believed the Face was an alien artifact photographing Colonia became a priority for NASA when Global Surveyor arrived at the Red Planet in September. 1997, eighteen long years ago after the Viking missions ended.",0
"The Face on Mars is one of the most controversial landforms around. Many people think that it is an artifact that was left behind by past civilizations on Mars. On the other hand, there are people that believe it is just a mesa, ""landforms common around the American West."" There are many people in both parties, making for a huge ""debate."" The most logical, however, is that the Face is naturally occurring, due to the evidence that NASA has been able to uncover.",0
"The people that say it is an ancient civilization use illogical evidence for their conclusions, such as, ""alien markings were hidden by haze."" However, the people that believe it is naturally occurring use stable evidence, including, ""Main's team captured an extraordinary photo using the camera's absolute maximum resolution.' Each pixel in the 2001 image spans 1.56 meters, compared to 43 meters per pixel in the best 1976 Viking photo."" This evidence shows that the best technology we have shows nothing more than, ""a lava dome that takes the form of and isolated mesa about the same height as the Face on Mars.""",0
"Another way to show that the Face on Mars is naturally occurring is the comparison to the landforms here on Earth, such as the mesa landforms in the American West. In the passage, Jim Gavin, a chief scientist at NASA, working specifically on Mars exploration, is quoted saying,""It reminds me most of Middle Butte in the Snake River Plain of Idaho."" Gavin, as said before, is a chief scientist at NASA. If he concludes that it is just like a landform people can see here, then why would anyone be able to argue that?",0
People strive to find out what is in the unknown. Researchers are some of the people that put their lives into getting the best evidence that they can find about the unknown. The Face on Mars is one example of many projects scientists have put time and effort into. They will always find the best solution or answer to whatever the question may be. Why not trust their conclusions?,0
Introduction,1
"As an eighth-grade student, I believe that education should be enjoyable, engaging, and interactive. This essay will explore three types of enjoyable educational activities available within my school: sports, science, and musical activities. I will compare and contrast the activities in terms of their enjoyment potential, and choose the most enjoyable activity and explain why it is preferable.",1
Sports,1
"Sports are a great way to stay active and healthy while also learning valuable life skills such as teamwork, discipline, and perseverance. Participating in sports can also help build self-esteem and confidence. However, not everyone enjoys sports, and it can be difficult to find a sport that is enjoyable for everyone. Additionally, sports can be expensive, and not everyone has the financial means to participate.",1
Science,1
"Science is another great way to learn and engage in an educational activity. Science can be both fun and challenging, and it can help students develop critical thinking skills and problem-solving abilities. Science can also help students understand the world around them and develop an appreciation for the natural world. However, science can be difficult for some students, and it may not be enjoyable for everyone.",1
Musical Activities,1
"Musical activities are a great way to express creativity and develop musical skills. Participating in a school band or choir can be a fun and rewarding experience, and it can also help students develop discipline and time management skills. Additionally, musical activities can be a great way to socialize and make new friends. However, not everyone enjoys music, and it can be difficult to find a musical activity that is enjoyable for everyone.",1
Comparison and Contrast,1
"While all three activities have their own unique benefits, they also have their own drawbacks. Sports can be expensive and not everyone enjoys them, science can be difficult and not everyone understands it, and musical activities can be limited to certain interests. However, I believe that the most enjoyable activity is science.",1
"Science is a great way to learn and engage in an educational activity. It can be both fun and challenging, and it can help students develop critical thinking skills and problem-solving abilities. Additionally, science can help students understand the world around them and develop an appreciation for the natural world. Science can also be a great way to socialize and make new friends.",1
Conclusion,1
"Education is a critical element of any high school student's future, and the importance of this education cannot be overstated. Unfortunately, it is not uncommon for some students to begin to identify their future career paths before completing their high school education. This premature commitment to one career can have major implications on a student's school work, mental health, and physical health. ",1
"One of the most significant potential problems with committing to a career at a young age is that students may be unprepared or under educated for their chosen profession. Without the necessary education or tools, students may be unable to succeed in their chosen careers, leading to feelings of frustration and diminished self-worth. Additionally, a premature commitment to a career can lead to unrealistic expectations, burn out, and a lack of motivation. ",1
"It is important to provide students with the necessary guidance and support to ensure they have the best chance for success in their future endeavors. Encouraging students to take their time to explore and research various career paths can have positive impacts on their mental and physical health, as well as their school work. Providing students with the tools and resources to develop an individualized plan for their future career can help to ensure that they have the best possible chance of achieving success.",1
"Do you think asking multiply people for advice is better than asking one person? Well I think asking multiple people for advice when I need it just to help me get a better understanding, better idea on what to do, see what other peoples thoughts are or sometimes see who gives better advice for future references. During this essay we will be talking about all those things and how they can help.",0
"Getting a better idea on what to do from other people such as school counselors, teacher,parent or guardian, siblings, your friends or anyone you can trust to help, makes decision-making so much better and easier. It's better to see different view points from different people. Then trying to make a hard decision or trying to explain something to someone or even having zero clue on what to do. For example trying to write an essay without brainstorming or having any thought on what to write or type about it's going to be really hard and stressful.",0
Seeing what other people think when getting advice can sometimes be difficult or helpful. It can be difficult if people don't understand or just don't know what to do and how to explain it to you to think they know what there talking about. It can also be helpful if they understand were your coming from or might have been in the same situation or been down the same path. When looking for advice try finding someone who knows what's going on or has or had the same situation. Make it easier on yourself to find those people even tho it might be difficult just remember you have those people listed above.,0
"If you are ever needing advice ask multiple people for there input or thoughts to see who gives the info you think fits what you need such as, who's you like better, is more detailed, on the subject you need and helps the most etc. when it comes to the people you ask for advice from it is most important you can trust them, and they give you good advice and those are the people who can help you with future references when you need advice down the road. Never rely on someone who is going to lie to you and you don't trust because those people will not help you, and they will make it more difficult and confusing.",0
In conclusion asking multiple people for advice is more likely more reasonable to help you find what you're looking for and get the information you will need than just asking one person who might have zero clue on what to tell you that will help your situation.,0
" Students would benefit from attending a regular school rather than relying on online or video conferencing classes. While there may be some convenience to learning from home, the benefits of attending a physical school far outweigh the negatives. Students will learn more and have a better chance of success if they attend a regular school.",1
"One of the main advantages of attending a regular school is the opportunity for face-to-face interaction with teachers and classmates. This interaction allows for better communication and understanding of course material, as well as the ability to ask for help and clarification when needed. It also allows for the development of relationships with classmates and the opportunity to participate in extracurricular activities.",1
"Another benefit of attending a regular school is the ability to stay active and engaged in the learning process. In a physical classroom, students are more likely to be actively participating in class discussions, asking questions, and collaborating with their peers. This engagement can lead to better retention of information and a deeper understanding of the material.",1
"Additionally, attending a regular school can provide students with a sense of community and belonging. Being surrounded by other students and teachers can provide a support system and a sense of belonging, which can be especially important for students who may be struggling academically or emotionally.",1
"While there may be some convenience to learning from home, the benefits of attending a regular school far outweigh the negatives. Students will learn more, stay active and engaged, and have a better chance of success if they attend a regular school.",1
"I think driverless cars sound like a good idea on paper, but in the real world they just are not far enough advanced yet for me to feel safe being in or around one.",0
"They are not even fully driverless yet, a person still needs to be ready to take the wheel at any given time.",0
"However, in the future when they become more advanced and safe they could potential prevent accidents.",0
I think driverless cars are still a thing of the future and not present.,0
"As much as I think they need to work now, I am not against the development of them as they could bring many potential benefits.",0
"In the article it states how movies and television shows have been fascinated with driverless cars for a long time, seeing them as a thing of the future.",0
I think they still are a thing of the future because they still need a driver to be able to take the wheel at any given time.,0
"The only way I can see them being the safest they can be, is if all cars are driverless, and they could interact with each other.",0
"Right now the driverless cars are mostly just assisting like antilock brakes, as stated in paragraph six.",0
When the technology eventually becomes good enough to be able to fully drive without a driver there are still laws to be discussed.,0
"Only a few states allow them so far, and what good is a car that is only legal in three states and the District of Columbia if you do not live there.",0
I think eventually the laws will change enough to allow them to function as long as they are safe and can pass certain tests.,0
"Then the question comes up about blame in the event of an accident, whose fault is it if a computer is controlling the vehicle?",0
As of now driverless cars seem to be more trouble than help.,0
"With time, I feel that they could become very safe and reliable vehicles with advancements in technology.",0
"There are many manufacturers trying to make driverless cars, at least one of them is bound to make something good eventually.",0
"In conclusion, I think driverless cars should keep being developed, however they still need a lot of work.",0
"Traveling is a great way to explore new places, meet new people, and take a break from everyday life. Many people choose to travel with a group and a tour guide, believing it is the best way to experience a new destination. I agree that traveling in a group led by a tour guide is the best way to travel; doing so provides safety and security, the benefit of a knowledgeable guide, and the chance to meet new people.",1
"The first and arguably most important benefit of traveling in a group with a tour guide is safety and security. A reliable guide will be familiar with the area, knowledgeable about the current political situation, and able to provide advice on local customs. A guide will also be able to suggest the best places to stay and eat, and can help provide directions if a group gets lost. Additionally, by traveling in a group, it is less likely that members of the group will be targeted by thieves or attackers.",1
"The second benefit of traveling with a tour guide is the benefit of a knowledgeable guide who can provide valuable insight into the history and culture of the destination. A good guide will provide important information about the local sites, culture, and even the local economy. A guide can also help explain the local customs and laws, which can be especially helpful for those who are unfamiliar with the area.",1
"The third benefit of traveling with a tour guide is the chance to meet new people and make new friends. By traveling with a group, tourists have the chance to meet other travelers who have similar interests and who may have come from different parts of the world. The opportunity to meet new people and share experiences with them can be very rewarding and can help to create lasting memories.",1
"In conclusion, I believe that traveling in a group led by a tour guide is the best way to travel. A tour guide can provide safety and security, the benefit of a knowledgeable guide, and the chance to meet new people. By traveling with a tour guide, tourists can explore new destinations and cultures safe in the knowledge that they are in good hands.",1

"I am writing to you today to express my opinion on the Electoral College system in the United States. As a student, I have been studying the history and workings of our democratic system, including the Electoral College. After careful consideration and analysis of different perspectives, I have come to the conclusion that the Electoral College should be abolished and replaced with a simple popular vote.",1
"First, the Electoral College is an outdated system that does not reflect the will of the people. In the last five presidential elections, the winner of the popular vote did not win the Electoral College four times. This means that the person who received the most votes from the citizens of the United States was not elected as the president. This is a clear violation of the democratic principle of “one person, one vote.”",1
"Second, the Electoral College gives disproportionate power to small states. Because each state is guaranteed a minimum of three electors, regardless of its population, a vote in a small state like Wyoming has four times the power of a vote in a large state like California. This means that the interests and needs of small states are often favored over those of larger states, which is unfair to the majority of the population.",1
"Third, the Electoral College creates an uneven playing field for candidates. Because most states award all their electoral votes to the candidate who wins the popular vote in their state, candidates focus their campaigns on swing states instead of the needs of the entire country. This means that some states and their issues are ignored, while others receive disproportionate attention.",1
"In conclusion, the Electoral College is a flawed system that needs to be replaced with a simple popular vote. A popular vote would ensure that the winner of the presidency reflects the will of the people and that every vote counts equally. This would be a more fair and just system for all Americans.",1
Thank you for your attention to this important matter.,1

"Venus is the hottest planet in our solar system. It could also be one of the most dangerous planets too. In ""The Challenge of Exploring Venus"" the author thinks it's a good idea to strive further into exploring Venus even with the dangers the planet contains.",0
"One of the reasons the author believes we should keep finding new things about Venus is because it was though to be similar to Earth. Venus and Earth are even called ""twins"" because they are thought to be so alike. Venus was thought to once be covered in oceans that could have possibly supported life at a point in time. Venus also contains similar things to Earth like valleys, mountains, and craters. The only way we could figure more things out about Venus would be if we kept sending this such as rovers to research it and possibly humans one day.",0
"Another reason the author thinks we should find more information about Venus is because Venus is one of the closest planets to Earth in our solar system aside from Mars. Venus or Mars would be the next step in our space exploration. If we do send rovers or people to Venus one day, we would need things that could withstand the heat and other chaos that happens on the surface of Venus. The author states that NASA has come up with an idea that contained a blimp-like vehicle that would hover about 30 miles above the surface of Venus that would carry scientists and would allow them to study the surface. The temperatures inside the blimp would be about 170 degrees Fahrenheit and air pressure that would be close to sea level on Earth. The conditions would be rough, but humans can withstand it.",0
"Though Venus is dangerous, that doesn't mean it's not possible for humans or rovers to explore its surface one day. Humans are driven by curiosity that leads us into similar places. If we can make it to the Moon, we can most likely one day make it to Venus and back. If humans were to one day even land on Venus, it would be a giant achievement for the human race.",0
"Think about walking into your second period class, and you have a test. This is a test that you have to pass, but you have no clue what the test is going to be over. You sit down, and your heart starts pounding so fast that you feel sick to your stomach. You're so scared to take this test because your not sure if you're going to pass it or not. ""You make begin"", your teacher says. Reading a few questions in your head and you don't know any of the answers. Have you ever thought about technology being able to help you? Should technology be able to read students emotional expressions?",0
The Facial Action Coding System is a 3D computer model of the face. It uses your facial muscles to determine how your feeling. For example if you are feeling anger the computer would know because your orbicularis Boris tightens your lips to show the anger. This device would be able to be showed by a real face or even a painting like the Mona Lisa. This computer can even show mixed emotions.,0
"Technology is a valuable resource for students. The new technology called the ""Facial Actions Coding System"" would be great for students. This is something that will be able to read your face and let people know if your bored, tired, happy, sad, and it even shows your fears. If your struggling on a test or an assignment it will give you help and walk you through some problems. This would help many students understand the concept and test scores would be so much higher.",0
"According to the article people are able to tell if you are having a bad day. People can not tell what is wrong with you just because you look sad or upset. Vinci studied human anatomy to help paint facial muscles that can convey certain emotions. If you look at the painting of Mona Lisa you would be able to tell from her facial structures of what type of mood she is trying to show. When looking at the Mona Lisa, it really intended to make you smile and in a happy mood.",0
How would you want to feel when taking a test and understanding the concept better? Wouldn't you want to be able to have higher test scores and better grades? Do you think that the Facial Action Coding System is a valuable resource for students?,0
The FACS would benefit a lot of students in the world. Do you think that technology should be able to read students emotions?,0
"The development of distance learning classes has dramatically altered the way students approach their schooling. Distance learning classes have provided students with more opportunities to become self-directed and self-motivated, while creating new obstacles to overcome when it comes to taking responsibility for their own education. Some students may take advantage of the lack of structure present in these classes by skipping classes and engaging in activities that are non-academic in nature. This type of self-imposed irresponsibility can have an immensely negative impact on their motivation and expectations for their learning. On one hand, the lack of structure and supervision can allow students the freedom to take more responsibility for their own learning, but on the other hand, it can lead to neglect of their educational obligations. Ultimately, distance learning classes have opened up new possibilities for students in terms of learning opportunities, as well as potential pitfalls in terms of difficulty in maintaining motivation and expectations for their own education.",1
"I disagree with the principal's decision that all students must participate in at least one extracurricular activity. While extracurriculars provide many benefits, mandatory participation should not be required for several reasons.",1
"Firstly, not all students have the time or availability to commit to an after-school activity every week. Many students have jobs, care for family members, or have long commutes that make staying late difficult. Forcing these students to choose between their responsibilities and following the new rule is unreasonable. ",1
"Secondly, extracurricular activities will not appeal to all students' interests. There is a wide variety of clubs and sports, but not all students will find one they genuinely enjoy. Forcing participation could cause unhappiness and discouragement rather than promoting engagement. Students should have freedom to decide how they spend their free time.",1
"Finally, some students may have physical, medical, or psychological conditions that prevent safe involvement in competitive groups. While many activities accommodate special needs, mandatory policies do not consider individual circumstances. This could disadvantage vulnerable students and interfere with personal healthcare decisions. ",1
"Instead of a mandatory policy, the principal could encourage involvement through persuasive recommendations highlighting benefits like leadership, teamwork and stress relief. Students still able to choose while being informed. Subsidies for low-income families could improve access without compulsion. ",1
"In conclusion, while extracurriculars offer valuable skills and memories, mandatory participation policies infringe on students' freedom and circumstances. Positive promotion better serves more interests than blanket rules. Students' well-being, availability and self-direction should determine their involvement in after-school activities.",1
"New software has been developed that improves accuracy in perceiving the emotions of others. According to some new computer software that can recognize emotions. The children said (hold up! Can we actually ""calculate"" emotions like math homework? The evidence is that there is a computer that makes a 3d model of your face. In the article it says that the computer can even show mixed emotions. The computer could even store's similar Thing inside of someone.(introduction) . It will be great for a teacher to use because you will be able to see the or she is confused of if they are bored etc. They made that because their is a lot of that have thing wrong with them the just don't like expressing their feelings. But to wrap it all up animate faces are more expressive. The computer is cool the way it can scan peoples mood. Another cool feature about that I personal like is that how it could the what bones and how many bones are inside your body. And it's cool because most people do not like to communicate so the computer tells you what are they thinking and also how are they feeling.",0

"I am writing to suggest that we consider implementing a policy change to require a minimum B grade in sports. I believe that this would motivate students to work harder and achieve better grades, leading to a more engaged student body and improved health outcomes.",1
"By requiring a minimum B grade in sports, students would be more likely to take the time to learn and improve their skills, rather than simply participating for the sake of participation. This would lead to a more competitive and challenging environment, which would in turn lead to better performance and improved athletic abilities.",1
"Furthermore, a minimum B grade in sports would encourage students to take their grades more seriously and seek help from their teachers or stay after school for tutoring. This would lead to a more focused and dedicated student body, which would translate to better academic performance overall.",1
"I also believe that a minimum B grade in sports would make colleges more interested in recruiting students who have demonstrated a high level of dedication and commitment to their athletic pursuits. This would lead to more scholarships and opportunities for students who excel in sports, which would be a great motivator for them to continue working hard in their academic pursuits.",1
"Finally, I believe that a minimum B grade in sports would help reduce the number of students who struggle with test anxiety or poor study habits. By requiring a minimum B grade in sports, students would be more likely to prioritize their studies and develop good study habits, which would translate to better performance on exams and tests.",1
"In conclusion, I believe that a minimum B grade in sports would have many positive effects on our school and its students. I urge you to consider this policy change and I believe it would be a great benefit for our school and its students.",1

"Would you want to be forced to spend extra time at school? In my opinion you should not have to be forced into an extra activity because people have things to do after school. Also, they already spend 7 or 8 hours at school and should not have extra time. Adding to that people need a break from school to be refreshed the next day because school is stressful.",0
"Students should not be forced to attend after school activities adding to their day because some students have activities after school like music lessons. Students come home from a long day of school and have homework to do and should not have an after school activity because that will give them less time for homework. Also, some students have a job and an after school activity can effect them financially. Also, some students for me as an example have music lessons after school and that cannot happen if there is an added activity to my schedule.",0
Students already spend 7 or 8 hours at school and should not have to spend extra time. Students need a break because school can be stressful and with an extra activity you could be with someone you don't like or just want to be home and the activity will delay that. Being at home you can also feel independent because at school you have to ask to get water or use the bathroom and at home you can anything whenever you want and spending 8 hours of having to ask to get water or use the bathroom can really be a pain and being at an extra activity can lengthen that.,0
"Students need a break from school because school is hard. School is a stressful place and the longer the break from it the better the next day will be. Also tests can be stressful and to do good on that test you need to be free minded and be refreshed, and you can do that by not going to an extra activity. Besides people at school can be stressful, for example if there is someone at school bullying you being home away from them can make you feel safe.",0
"Having to be forced to and extra school activity should not be permitted because students have things after school, Also they are already at school for 7 or 8 hours and need a break, and adding to that students just need a break. The brain works better on a clear mind and having an after school activity can lessen that.",0
"There are positive consequences as well as negative consequences for the development of these Driverless Cars. It's good that technology is advancing, and the world is in a better place because of these things. It's not bad that things are starting to change including our daily use cars. Furthermore, it's good to be able to create new things that are interesting and enjoy the things that are being produced. I oppose to this new invention of cars, however.",0
"People might be excited hearing this advance technology such as the Driverless Cars that are being introduced. However, I'm against these Driverless Cars that are about to be sold. You might think that cars being controlled by itself without the drivers would be fascinating and cool for you, but there is also danger ahead of us. Of course, it's the job for the companies to sell out to you and try to earn whatever amount of money they could, it's not their responsibility of driving for us after buying it. The cars are not even fully recommended by the producers yet; they are finding ways to improve it. However, it's not fully guarantee that we will be safe as long as we are in the car.",0
"It's our choice whether we want to get this new car or not, but know that in your mind there will at least a consequence. These cars are cool and looks awesome in our eyes, nor is a Bliss to own one. Even so, we should know that these cars are not a hundred percent safe. The text state,"" This means the human driver must remain alert and be ready to take over when the situation requires. "" This shows that we also have to ready to take over when something doesn't seem right. It's not like the Driverless Cars will take care of us.",0
"Imagine you are texting while in these Driverless Cars going to your work. You just let the car control when suddenly a road ahead of you is being constructed, at that moment, you probably might not be alert or anything. The car then had an accident and the one to blame is you, the driver. What I meant to say is that these cars aren't that safe as we think it is. We also have to take the responsible for Bangor alert or else something might happen. The text said that if the technology fails and someone is injured, who is at fault-the driver or the manufacturer? This tells us that it's not guarantee that the manufacturer will take full responsibility of us when something bad happens. We have to take care of ourselves.",0
"These Driverless Cars might be convenient in some ways, but always know that it's not always safe. What's the use of always staying on alert when you bought the car thinking it can drive itself without the need of the driver. Even thought it's a fancy thing that the car could drive by itself, it still needs the help of the driver. If something is about to happen in the middle of the highway, what are you going to do? It's really dangerous just thinking about it. Our life really determine on our own actions when driving this Drivels Cars. Some people might find the cars a good thing, but for me, I really am against it.",0
"Driving while texting is very dangerous for people on the roads. Millions of people have died from car accidents and texting while driving. I don't have driver license yet, but I will be safe on the road when I get them. I have been in car accidents because other people were not paying attention and hit our car. Furthermore, I am glad they created the Hands-Free law to keep us safe.",0
The Hands-Free law was created to keep people from communicating while behind the wheel. If you have something to tell someone it can wait until you pull over. Car accidents happen everyday on the interstate because people are not aware of their surroundings. I would agree with people using their phone behind the wheel only for emergencies. Most people are not good with multitasking and driving.,0
"I have driven while on my phone only to run an errand. I was bored, so I called my friend to figure out other plans. Furthermore, I was safe while using my phone nothing happened. Although, that doesn't make chances short it won't happen next time. I will be more careful next time to decision or drunk drivers to.  ",0
"Dear Senator,",1
I am writing to you today to express my support for abolishing the Electoral College and electing the President of the United States by popular vote.,1
"The Electoral College is an outdated system that is no longer reflective of the will of the people. In the past five presidential elections, the candidate who won the popular vote lost the election twice. This is unacceptable. In a democracy, the candidate who receives the most votes should win the election.",1
"There are many reasons why the Electoral College is unfair. First, it gives more power to voters in small states than in large states. This is because each state has a minimum of three electoral votes, regardless of its population. For example, a voter in Wyoming has about three times the voting power as a voter in California.",1
"Second, the Electoral College can lead to the election of a president who does not have the support of a majority of the people. This has happened twice in the past five elections. In 2000, George W. Bush won the presidency even though he lost the popular vote to Al Gore. In 2016, Donald Trump won the presidency even though he lost the popular vote to Hillary Clinton.",1
"Third, the Electoral College encourages candidates to focus their campaigns on a few swing states, rather than campaigning throughout the country. This is because a candidate can win the presidency with a majority of the electoral votes, even if they do not win the most popular votes.",1
I urge you to support abolishing the Electoral College and electing the President of the United States by popular vote. This would be a fair and democratic way to choose our president.,1

"25 years ago, around Mars, a spacecraft from NASA was circling the planet.",0
"It was taking pictures, until something strange happened. An enormous head appeared and seemed to be staring back at the camera.",0
"A few scientists believed the Face, was made by an ""alien."" NASA has been discussing of what have may cause making a face on Mars. We had millions of answers but didn't know which one was right.",0
"Aliens did it. They are the ones who created the face! ""Scientists believe the Face was an alien artifact."" First, no one knows for sure what have may have caused it. It could've been the atmosphere, or it could've been an ""alien."" Scientists thought it was probably a ""Martian mesa"", only this one almost looked like an ""Egyptian Pharaoh."" You see, the shadow gave an ""illusion of eyes, nose and mouth.""",0
"It was a good way to attract the public to the attention of Mars. ""There was no alien monument after all.""",0
"A Thousand of people wondered and were curious about the Face on Mars. ""On April 8, 2001, Mars Global Surveyor drew close enough for a second look."" Close enough, they could predict what the image appeared. ""So, if there were objects in this picture like airplanes on the ground or Egyptian-style pyramids or even small shacks, you could see what they were!"" The pictured showed landforms most common, and you could relate to Earth. ""It reminds me most of Middle Butte in the Snake River Plain of Idaho,"" said Gavin.",0
"In conclusion, from 1976 to 2001, no one knows exactly what does the Face mean. The sensation was short.",0
"NASA says it could've been a ""huge rock formation..."" It became a popular icon. It has starred in a Hollywood film, appeared in books, magazine, radio talk shows."" Some people think the Face is ""bona fide"" evidence life on Mars. But what do you think? Do you think it was made by an alien?",0
"Do you believe that aliens do exist? Well, were not sure. You see it could be anything.",0
"Usage of cars should be limited for many reasons.  Many people in different countries agree that cars should be either banned or not used as constantly.  Pollution, Economy, and people's health are all a factor to limiting car usage.",0
"In Vauban, Germany, people have given up their cars. There is a fee to park in Vauban which is a coast of $40,000.  No one is going to want to drive due to that outrageous price.  70 percent of the people living in Vauban doesn't own a car and, 57 percent sold their car once they moved there.  ""'When I had a car I was always tense.  I'm much happier this way' said Hadron Walter"".  This quote shows that cars just bring you done emotional, and you'll feel better without one.  In Vauban, cars are causing 12 percent of greenhouse gases.  The percent of greenhouse gases are four times higher in the U.S. do to car's gas emissions.",0
"In Paris, there is a smog problem going on.  There is so much pollution in the air that there was a forced ban on driving.  If anyone was found driving they were fined $31.  4,000 people were fined and 27 had their cars taken do to not wanting to pay the fine or being difficult.  Paris had the most smog out of the European country; in Paris there were 147 micrograms of particulate matter, Brussels had 114 and, London had 79.7.",0
"Bogotá, Colombia has an annual car-free day.  A day full of hiking, biking, skating and bus riding.  If found driving on the car-free day you are fine with $25.  ""'It's a good opportunity to take away stress and lower air pollution,' said businessman Carlos Plaza"".  President Obama is getting involved with the limiting car usage also. His goal is to curb the greenhouse gas emissions.  There have been fewer cars bought and licenses given out as the years go by.  Lastly, there has been a 23 percent decrease in young people driving from the years 2001 to 2009.",0
These are some reasons why car usage should be limited; and as you can see many countries are starting to make a difference.,0

"Others should join the program because you get to travel around the world. Luke stated that he went to China and Europe! He traveled the Pacific and Atlantis ocean several times. He's been to Greece. If you like to travel, this would be a great program to join.",0
"Luke feeds and waters the animals. Luke has to check on the animals every hour. I would join this program because I'm an animal person and I would love to spend weeks, maybe even months with these animals. Others who aren't animal people maybe shouldn't join this program. It would be a great way to interact with the animals if you don't like animals all that much.",0
"Joining this program could teach you something. It could teach you many things. It could teach you to be more cautious about things. As Luke stated ""It made me more aware of people of other countries and their needs."" This program can make you more grateful for everything. It could make you work harder instead of being lazy. You could actually get things done if you were to join this program. That is why I think you should join.",0

"I am writing to express my support for maintaining the Electoral College system for electing the President of the United States. While switching to a national popular vote may seem attractive in theory, I believe the Electoral College is a better system and helps protect our democratic process in several important ways.",1
"One argument made in favor of a popular vote is that it would make every citizen's vote equally important. However, the current system encourages candidates to build broader coalitions and appeal to a wider geographic range of voters. Without the Electoral College, candidates could focus all their efforts on population centers, ignoring the concerns of rural states. This could diminish political participation across large parts of the country. ",1
It is also important to consider that the United States is a representative republic rather than a pure democracy. The Founders intentionally created the Electoral College to have the President elected by representative electors instead of a direct vote. They feared that passions of the moment could sway a national popular vote. The Electoral College system helps safeguard against temporary emotional reactions and promotes more stable and long-term decision-making. ,1
"Finally, opponents argue that a candidate could lose the national popular vote but still win the election. While this has occurred a few times, it is not necessarily a flaw but rather a feature of federalism. The Electoral College requires candidates to assemble blocs of support across many states rather than just in population centers. This ensures that candidates pay attention to political considerations nationwide rather than just in a handful of cities or regions. ",1
"In conclusion, while reasonable people can disagree on this issue, I believe the Electoral College has served our country well and helps preserve key aspects of our democratic process. It deserves to be maintained as our system for electing the President. I hope you will consider supporting it as well. Thank you for your consideration.",1

"The concept that a culture perpetuates its own ideas and fears through formal education is undeniably true, and is exemplified in many forms in our society today. Though there is some level of debate around what certain concepts should be taught, and how they should be presented, it is largely agreed that formal education is an essential part of a culture's ability to maintain its own values, beliefs, and fears.",1
"To begin, formal education allows a culture to pass on it's most cherished beliefs to the next generation. This is done by incorporating cultural values into the curriculum and encouraging students to adopt these values for themselves. For example, many school curriculums include a focus on the importance of democracy, the value of hard work, and the importance of respecting and protecting the environment. These core values are embedded into the curriculum, allowing students to learn and internalize these ideas in a way that is often more meaningful and effective than simply teaching facts and figures.

"Furthermore, formal education can also be used to discredit ideas that a culture opposes or fears. In many cases, this involves pushing back against ideas and beliefs that are seen as contrary to existing values. For example, in many schools, students are taught not to accept racism or discrimination under any circumstance. This is done in part by teaching students about the painful effects of racism, and by emphasizing the need for acceptance of people of all backgrounds. In this way, formal education can not only teach students about what is acceptable, but also about what is unacceptable, and thus help to counter ideas that are seen as threatening to a culture.",1
"Finally, formal education also serves as a platform for a culture to express its fears and anxieties. By offering courses in history, literature, and other disciplines, students are exposed to the struggles and challenges that the culture has faced in the past, as well as the potential dangers that it faces in the present and future. For example, a course in world history may include a focus on the devastating effects of war, or a course in literature may include readings of dystopian fiction, allowing students to have a greater understanding of the fears and anxieties that their culture has experienced.",1
"In conclusion, formal education is an essential tool for a culture to perpetuate its ideas and fears. By teaching its core values, pushing back against dangerous ideas, and exposing students to its fears, formal education can help a culture maintain its identity and protect it'self from external threats. To put it'simply, formal education is the key to a culture's success.",1
"Of the many planets in our solar system, Venus would be the worst to travel to. This planet is highly dangerous. The conditions are horrendous, and some people are thinking of traveling there. The cost of building a ship capable of withstanding Venus's conditions would be crazily high. The fact that the author would want to travel to, and support the idea of, Venus is outrageous. Even then, they did not support their claim too well in their article.",0
"Venus is the second planet from the sun. According to the text, the surface temperature is over 800 degrees Fahrenheit. The atmosphere is almost 97 percent carbon dioxide. Also, the planet has many earthquakes, erupting volcanoes, and often has many lightning strikes that take down probes that wish to know the secrets of the surface. Pressure levels are also off the charts and could crush the ship anyone was travelling in.",0
"The author of the text was not too convincing of their claim to explore Venus. The title itself does not help the claim either This planet, as said by the author, is very dangerous. Traveling to Venus and making sure conditions are suitable for people, is not very achievable. The author seems to want to travel there and supports the idea, but they do not support their claim very much. Most of the article talks about how perilous the planet is for people to travel to. They could have supported themselves better if they talked about the benefits instead of only the dangers.",0
"All in all, travelling to Venus would be a waste of time and money. If NASA risks the lives of people by sending them, then the trip would be for nothing. With the dangerous conditions to consider, the contemplation of whether to travel there is out of the question. The answer is no. It's too unsafe to put peoples' lives on the line only because scientists are curious about a dangerous planet.",0
"Ralph Waldo Emerson says""unless you try to do something beyond what you have already mastered, you will never grow."" On one hand, some people disagree with statement. On the other hand, some people agree with this statement. People should try to do something beyond what they have already mastered since their confident level will grow, it makes them feel good, and make their live easier.",0
"However, not everybody agrees with position, some people claim that people can grow in live without trying something new because they don't want to get out of their comfort zone and try new things. Nevertheless, this opposition other important, namely that trying new things give us a high level of confident. For example, my biggest fear in live is airplanes and I have never been on it, but if I try it for the first time in my live even I scare or not next time, i would have more confident for trying new thing since when the airplane was my biggest fear and I try it. I could do more. Furthermore, trying new things make our confident level high which is an important thing in our live.",0
"In addition, it makes us feel good. For instance, my cousin was always sad, and she hated to try new things. One day we went swimming, everyone had fun except my cousin. After condensing her for a long time, she tries it. On that time, my cousin was so happy that she even wants to be a swimmer now. Thus, people should try new things to make them feel good and happy.",0
"Finally, it makes the live easy. To illustrate, if someone is so strike in live and doesn't want to try something beyond what he/she already mastered, that person will have a hard live. The person will never grow in live since he/she scares to get out the comfort zone and try new thing. Moreover, we should get out of our comfort zone, so we could have an easy live.",0
"Based on this argument, one must conclude, people never get better unless they try new things in live. In the whole, Ralph Waldo Emerson's statement was true based of the reasons.",0
"There are plenty advantages to limiting car use on this Earth. For example, limiting car use can lead to a cleaner environment, better overall health of the people and the Earth, and overall, just a better place to live. Cutting down on car usage can be very beneficial for the planet, along with future generations of people.",0
"First, limiting car use can lead to a better place to live in. If we were to slow down on the use of gas, there would be fewer wars over oil in other countries. We as a race can change the world, one car at a time. Lowering the amount of driving wouldn't be an easy change, but surely one worthwhile.",0
"Secondly, giving up cars completely might not be necessary, but emitting toxic gas fumes can be easily avoided simply by switching to an electric car. There are many affordable electric cars that can help stop the fumes from traveling into the ozone layer, which can prolong our Earth's life, our lives, and can stop global warming dead in its tracks. Who doesn't want to keep this wonderful weather?",0
"Lastly, cutting down on driving automobiles might have an effect on saving people from car accidents caused by unfit drivers. Thousands of people die every day from unnecessary car usage. If we were to cut the amount of driving in half, the rate of death due to car accidents would find a steep decline.",0
"In conclusion, limiting car usage can make the world a better place. This decision can lead to better health, less death due to car accidents, prolonging our planet's health, and fewer complaints about those roller-coaster like gas prices! It only takes one person to make a change, so decide if you want to be the one to potentially save the world.",0
"Cars are part of our daily routines, they have been around for so long that we can't even remember when they first showed up, but did you know that people are starting to use other means for transportation?. Studies have shown that the number of miles driven in the United States has dropped steadily ever since 2005, and as of April 2013, the number of miles driven per person was 9 percent below the peak.",0
"Part of the reason lies in the recession, Americans with a low income can't afford to buy new cars; not mentioning the unemployed, and now that recovery is under way, the next few years will be telling if the decrease will stop, or continue. But looking at the bright side, if the pattern persists (and many believe it will) it will be beneficial towards carbon emissions and the environment, without considering the fact that car transportation is one of the largest source of America's editions.",0
"America isn't the only country that has seen a major decrease in car transportation, other places have taken steps to decrease the use of cars. For example, in VAUBAN, Germany, the residents of this community have given up their cars, that's right!, Vauban's are completely ""car-free"". Owning a car is allowed, but they manly be parked in two places, garages that can be purchased for $40,000, and of course, a home. As a result, seventy percent of the population does not own a car.",0
"But why are they doing this?. Well, automobiles are used widely all around the globe, and that ID a huge impediment to drastically reduce greenhouse gas emissions from tailpipes. Cars are responsible for 12 percent of green house emissions in Europe... and up 50 percent in some car-intesive area in the United States, that's why some places are trying to stop using vehicles, the advantage of not using cars relies on the fact that cars are dangerous to our planet, and we have to take care of our planet.",0
"Finally,(and most importantly)France and Colombia are taking major steps to fight the over-use of cars. Since Paris has more smog than any other European capital, motorists with even-numbered license plates were ordered to leave their cars at home or suffer a 22-euro fine. The same would apply to odd-numberd plates the following day, as a result congestion was down 60 percent in Paris after 5 days. And in Bogotá, Colombia, there has been a ""car-free day"" for over three years now in an attempt to promote alternative transportation, people who refuse not use their cars are fine with a $25 dollar fine, because of this, the turnout has been large. And it has led to the construction oh 118 miles of bicycle paths.",0
So.... do you still want to use car?... or a bicycle?.  ,0
"The principle's decision of making all the students participate in extracurricular activities can be a good decision and a bad decision, but it can go either way. A lot of people probably agree with this decision because doing activities that is not sitting in your room on your phone or on other electronics can be fun. These activities can be something that you have never done before or something that you actually enjoy doing. I know that some students would try to come up with an excuse to not do activities because they don't feel like it, or they're lazy. On the other hand, other students do really like doing activities. For example, most kids do a sport, whether it is soccer, basketball, lacrosse, or baseball, I have seen kids enjoy doing sports. There are other activities like participating in a club like yearbook or serving on the student council. Even if you feel like nothing is for you there is always that one thing that you love doing or that one thing that keeps you company.",0
"Like I said this decision can go either way. Doing extracurricular activities can also be a bad thing because it can take up time. A lot of students have a busy schedule that they just don't have time for activities. For example, students could have other things they need to do at home like taking care of younger siblings, having a lot of homework to do, or preparing for a test. It could also be that a lot of students are independent and they just don't feel like working with other people. I remember that when I was younger I didn't like working with other kids, I was very independent. I didn't like when I was forced to do things with other kids. Since some students feel this way it would be a little sad that some kids would have be forced to do something that they don't like to do.",0
"When I was about nine years old my mom put me on a gymnastics team. At first, I was angry that my mom signed me up for gymnastics, but it wasn't because I didn't like gymnastics, it was because I didn't want to meet new people. After a week of being there I started to think that maybe it wasn't such a bad idea. Now I'm so glad that I listened to my mom. I really like participating in sports and other activities. Working with other people is really fun, even if I didn't like the idea at first. At the end of the day, even if there are bad outcomes from this decision, I agree with the principles decision.",0
"As an 8th grader, I strongly believe that attending school from home can have numerous benefits for students. While some may argue that traditional schools provide a more immersive learning experience, I believe that the advantages of distance learning far outweigh any drawbacks.",1
"Firstly, attending school from home can greatly benefit students who struggle with anxiety or depression. For these students, the pressure of navigating a crowded and noisy school environment can be overwhelming, leading to increased stress and anxiety. By attending school from home, these students can avoid the stressors of a traditional school setting and learn in a more comfortable and familiar environment. Additionally, distance learning can provide these students with more flexibility and control over their learning experience, which can be particularly helpful for students who struggle with self-regulation.",1
"Another benefit of attending school from home is the potential for improved academic performance. In a traditional school setting, drama and rumors can often distract from the learning process, leading to decreased productivity and motivation. By removing these distractions, distance learning can allow students to focus more intently on their academic work and achieve better grades. Furthermore, distance learning can provide students with more personalized attention and feedback from teachers, which can lead to improved academic outcomes.",1
"However, some may argue that distance learning lacks the social interaction and face-to-face communication that is essential for student development. While it is true that distance learning can lack the social aspect of traditional schooling, it can also provide students with the opportunity to connect with peers and teachers in a more flexible and convenient manner. For example, through video conferencing or online forums, students can participate in group discussions and collaborative projects without the need for in-person interactions.",1
"Finally, attending school from home can provide students with more flexibility and autonomy in their learning experience. Traditional schools often have rigid schedules and curricula, which can be limiting for students who have different learning styles or interests. By contrast, distance learning can provide students with more control over their learning pace and content, allowing them to pursue their interests and learning goals in a more personalized manner.",1
"In conclusion, while traditional schools have their own advantages, I believe that attending school from home can provide numerous benefits for students. By providing a more",1
"Dear Principal,",0
I believe no cell phones is the way to go. I believe this because students who use cell phones in school will be off task and no do there work.,0
One reason why I think this is because the students need to get an education and n not worry about that text they just received.,0
Another reason I have that might convince you to listen to this is because if you follow up with this rule students in the school will stop worrying about phones and more about school.,0
Witch means better grades and behavior and also better testing scores.,0
Maybe even less drama because as you see there are many conflicts that come from texting and social net works because someone said something over a text message.,0
"So by not allowing this you could possibly prevent fights, and other harmful situations from happening.",0
"Students also have all before school and after school even weekends to text, so it shouldn't be happening in school.",0
"If you were to let the students have their cell phones out and let them text, they wouldn't pay attention in class, not no what there doing, and get bad grades on important test and even homework.",0
They also might not listen to the teacher when he or she is talking witch might aggravate them and become mad at the student.,0
"To finalize this statement I have to share with you, I would like to say if you consider this idea this could really change how the school runs and make things better than they were.",0
"So thank you for reading this, and hopefully you consider this idea for a better and brighter future.",0

"Seeking multiple opinions when asking for advice can help someone make a better choice for a few key reasons. First, getting different perspectives allows you to consider more alternatives and options that you may not have thought of on your own. Each person you ask is likely to have had different experiences that could potentially provide new ideas or approaches. ",1
"Secondly, discussing your dilemma with more than one person acts as a check against any biases a single advisor might have. No one individual can ever provide a perfectly objective view - we all have our own preferences, prejudices or blind spots. However, balancing various viewpoints helps mitigate those influences by bringing more overall neutrality. You're less likely to be swayed in one direction if different advisors point out both pros and cons instead of just focusing on what favors their own preferences.",1
"A third benefit is that more counsel means more chances of getting well-rounded, thoughtful advice. Any individual you speak to may not consider all angles or implications of the choices comprehensively. But together, multiple advisors can point you toward factors you hadn't accounted for and play ""devil's advocate"" by countering arguments you'd made to yourself. No one person can anticipate and address every possible concern or objection, so combining insights broadens the advice. ",1
"In conclusion, while any one advisor could potentially provide helpful guidance, seeking input from a variety of trusted sources allows you to view your situation from more standpoints. This balanced approach can better equip you to weigh your options and ultimately make the choice that seems most reasonable after seriously evaluating alternatives from many perspectives. Getting multiple opinions helps ensure a decision is well-informed instead of potentially missing important things a single recommendation alone might overlook.",1
There are many people who say that the government shouldn't put money on building theaters and sports stadiums. They say that the money should be spent on medical care and education. Some people say that this is the best way to spend the money because it will help to improve the quality of life for people in the country. Others argue that the money should be put towards building more schools and hospitals. They say that this is the best way to help to improve the quality of life for people in the country and to provide more resources for those who need them.,1
"While distance learning provides flexibility, attending classes in person offers significant benefits that better support student development and learning. Some advantages of in-person classes include direct personal interactions, enhanced focus and attention, as well as access to resources that strengthen the learning experience. ",1
"Personal interactions are an invaluable part of the school experience. In a physical classroom, students can ask questions to their teachers and classmates face-to-face. Nuanced discussions and spontaneous collaborations often emerge from direct exchanges. Distance learning relies on electronic communication which can make real-time discussions more difficult and lacks the personal dimension of in-person interactions. ",1
"It can also be challenging for students to maintain focus and pay attention while learning from home, where distractions are plentiful. With their own entertainment and chores so accessible, students studying remotely may be tempted to multitask or have their attention wander. The structure of physically going to school helps form productive study habits and keeps students engaged during class time. ",1
"Attending class in person additionally provides access to important learning resources that may not be as easily available at home. Labs, workshops, libraries and specialized facilities enrich the educational experience in many subjects. Hands-on activities and demonstrations in areas like science and arts benefit greatly from in-person instruction. Extracurricular activities are also best supported through on-campus involvement versus online participation. ",1
"In conclusion, while distance learning has value in providing flexibility, students are generally better served through traditional in-person classes. The social and focused nature of campus education combined with access to helpful resources strengthen learning outcomes. Therefore, attending classes at school rather than from home better supports students' academic and personal development.",1

"In high school there are many difficult decisions to make. What classes to take? Do I want or need a job? Who should I associate with? What dress should I wear to the prom? You know, things like that. I know that you have recently stated that you would like all students to participate in some form of community service and even though it is a very stressful and busy time I completely agree.",0
"I think that it is very important to give to your community and always try to help out. Furthermore, I believe that some services could be picking up trash, tutoring, helping plant flowers around that school to make it look a little more welcoming. Furthermore, I also think that participating in this activity teaches responsibility, respect for hard work, and it also gives us an intake on things outside high school. This could also help some students decide on which career path to take. Depending on if they might realize some improvements that could be made to make the community better as a whole and decide to be on the town committee. Or even if they enjoy teaching younger kids and wish to follow a path into educating.",0
"This project, I believe, would better both our school and community in the long run. I hope that my perspective has helped you on your decision and I wish to thank you for your time and dedication you put into the bettering this school.",0

"In the article ""Making Mona Lisa Smile"" the author describes about how a new technology called Facial Action Coding System enables computers to identify humans emotions. I rather not be scanned by a computer to tell me my emotions. I don't think the Facial Action Coding System is valuable.",0
"The first reason that I think we shouldn't have computer scanning are face because we need privacy. I wouldn't want a computer scanning me to see if I was happy, sad, tired, or mad. Example of the computer testing someone"" She's 83 percent happy, 9 percent disgusted, 6 percent fearful, and 2 percent angry. Also, there's no need to know there emotions some people don't want you to.",0
"Second reason is that I wouldn't want to pay for it. Some students couldn't afford it. Others could buy it but why would they are at school to learn not to know other peoples emotions. Example what the emotion scanner would do"" if you smile when a web ad appears on your screen, a similar ad might follow. But if you from next ad will be I different."" This shows me that you don't need it because all it shows your emotions an what kinds ads others ruff that could help you. There's no point for this if it not helping you with school activities.",0
"Third reason is what's the point of having this. It does benefit a little bit by changing stuff the computer to change our mood. Example of this ""According to the Facial Feedback Theory of Emotion, moving your facial muscles only expresses emotions, but also may even help produce them."" But rather than that it doesn't help us. It doesn't help us get good grades, doesn't show us what to do in class, and doesn't help your teachers either.",0
"So in this article ""Making Mona Lisa Smile"" where they other talks about computer showing your emotions isn't valuable to any school. The Facial Coding System is just showing your emotions not helping you in school. It's also probably very expensive some people couldn't afford it. That's why I think it's not valuable or needed in a school.",0

There was never a significant meaning to having a car; it just meant having a vehicle that can get you from point A to point B.

Not being able to use a car seems like there is no bright side, but there are actually many advantages on limiting car usage.",0
"The United States always had this recognition of being one of the world's prime car cultures. ""The first Model T cars were born in the U.S. It has also been the place where Wilson Pickett immortalized 'Mustang Sally."" President Barack Obama identifies in the article,",0
"The End of Car Culture, his dreams for the U.S. ""to curb the United States's been house gases emissions will get a fortuitous assist from an incident shift in American behavior."" Going back to the article as reference, studies show ""Americans are buying fewer cars, driving less, and getting fewer licenses as each year goes by... as of April 2013, the number of miles driven per person was nearly 9 percent below the peak... there was also a drop in percent of 16- to 39- year olds getting a license."" The cause of the downfall in car usage can be pointed towards a few factors; internet making telecommuting possible, the renewal of center cities, and the rise of cellphones and car-pooling apps. It is not because society assumes cars are becoming of no use, the role of technological improvements are making things a lot easier than how things were in the 1960s. The United States have the option of using cars or not, in other places like Paris, the option to drive has become a choice made out of a person's own power.",0
"Paris, France is a location that anyone dreams of visiting. The city is beautiful, but the levels of smog have made it impossible for people to enjoy the views of the city. According to the article,",0
"Paris bans driving due to smog, ""it has been enforced to the citizens of a partial driving ban in order to clear the air... people were ordered to leave their cars at home or suffer a 22-euro fine which is $31 in the United States."" The way things are organized in Paris goes by a person's license plate number. In correlation to the article, ""congestion was down 60 percent in the capital of France, after five-days of intensifying smog."" However, not all the cars used in Paris, France were banned. Those cars that are plug-ins, hybrids, and cars carrying three or more passengers were allowed to roam the street of Paris. A good majority, 67 percent, of vehicles in France are made up of diesel, and that kind of fuel were the ones to blame since gasoline was not in favor in a city like that one. In the same way, places like Bogotá, Colombia, had similar situations as the people that live in France.",0
"In the country of Colombia there has been a day dedicated to doing things with no car; it's a car-free day. In contrast to how banning driving is in Paris, Bogotá, Colombia has everyone participate in this 24-hour event. If a person were to violate the rule they are to face $25 fines. The article,",0
"Car-free day is spinning into a big hit in Bogotá, explains that ""millions of Colombians hike, bike, skate, or take buses to work during the car-free day."" Just like the goals in Paris, Colombia has goals to promote alternative transportation and reduce smog. A businessman, Carlos Arturo Plaza, explains ""its good opportunity to take away stress and lower air pollution."" No one would everything that driving is as stressful as going to work. When put into mind, things begin to make sense. The early mornings of road rage people encounter makes their entire day a little more stressful than what it should be. Driving is a wonderful advantage, but there is always more than just a car. Colombia's main goal, as expressed in the article ""is to promote alternative transportation and reduce smog.""",0
"In the end of it all cars have always been in the making; trying to find new ways to improve and modernize. Although cars may have had significant meanings in the older times, as society continues to prosper in technological making, cars are beginning to be identified as material objects that are not as important.

Global warming is becoming more of an issue as time goes on, part of this problem is vehicles and their pollution they let off. People are getting more and more worried about this as temperatures continue to rise on Earth. They are trying to do something about it. One of the more popular suggestions to help solve the issue is to limit car usage. I know, it seems pretty bizarre due to the fact that some towns, such as my own, do not have everything citizens need within a walking distance. Genetically, ""stores are being placed a walkaway, on a main street, rather than in malls along some distant highway. Rosenthal 6"".

Passenger cars are responsible for 12 percent of greenhouse gas emissions in Europe... and up to 50 percent in some areas of the United States Rosenthal 5"". People also are not putting forth an effort to help decrease the pollution by buying hybrids, instead they buy Diesels. Diesel gas has more pollutants than regular gasoline.",0
"Safety is another reason to reduce car usage. Think about it, if pedestrians reduced their car usage by 50 percent the percentage of car accidents would also decrease. This could save many people's lives animals as well. Rosenthal said, ""Cities could become denser, and better for walking"", which also makes it safer. To go along with saving lives lets mention health. Americans are getting more and more unhealthy and overweight. It is a rising problem in our country. Many people die from it everyday obesity can be stopped. One way to lose weight and get in shape is exercise. Imagine how much better shape Americans would be in if we actually had to walk to the grocery store or McDonald's. It would make us think ""do we really need that?"". Those extra burned calories count, sitting in a car does not burn many calories.",0
"Traffic jams are aggravating to most people, with the decreasing number of car owners time is being saved. There is less traffic. Andrew Silky studied carefree day in Bogotá, and he stated ""rush hour restrictions have dramatically cut traffic28"", this means time is being saved and people are getting to their destinations faster. Another idea was said by Carlos Arturo Plaza ""it's a good opportunity to take away stress... Selsky 24"". Congestion stresses everyone out, whether running on time, running late or just taking a leisurely drive. It makes everyone stress. Congestion actually decreased 60 percent in Paris Duffer 14. Hadron Walter also said ""When I had a car I was always tense. I'm much happier this way."" Limiting car usage helps a number of problems throughout the globe, such as to save time, conserve resources, lower emissions, improve safety, and even improve your health Rosenthal 43. You may wonder what other ways are there for you transport to the places you need to go. You could walk, jog, hike, bike, skate, or take public transportation. There are so many options, and you have the opportunity to meet new people and exercise if you're having a busy day. America should try it out just for a day and see what it leads to.",0
"In recent years, the use of technology and digital resources have influenced how people interact with one another. Examples such as Google Translator, Google, and YouTube have become more commonplace in our day-to-day lives, making it increasingly easy to influence someone without having to use physical examples. However, there are still many other ways to influence someone without relying on examples, such as verbal communication and body language. ",1
"Verbal communication and body language are still effective means for conveying thoughts, feelings, and intentions. Through the use of words, facial expressions, and gestures, people can easily communicate their desires to one another without being constrained by the need to provide examples or visuals. Even when someone may not understand the language of the speaker, these other forms of communication can still serve to influence. ",1
"While technology and digital resources are convenient and often times helpful when trying to influence someone, they should not be relied upon as the only means. There is much to be said for considering other options such as verbal communication and body language, as the impact they have on the listener should not be trivialized. By understanding the many ways in which we can influence someone, we can better equip ourselves with the knowledge and resources needed to effectively communicate our ideas and intentions without using tangible examples.",1

"Cell phones should be a privilege each student should receive. Students should be able to use their phones during lunch period or other free time. As long as it will be off during class. Students should be able to use their phones during free time for important emergencies and parent contact for an important reason. Also, students should be able to use are phone to send a text message to a friend about something they need to talk about.",0
During free time students should be allowed to use phones to contact their friends or family if anything happened to them. If your child was in school when something happened to them wouldn't you want to know about it? Wouldn't you want to find out how it happened and help them? That's why I think cell phones are an important device to have with you if anything happens. You could call for help or be able to call your friends to talk to them.,0
Kids these days like electronics. That's what's it's all about. Texting friends and playing games. Kids should have a privilege like that in school. During free time or when their walking the track. Kids should be able to listen to music and text. I think we should be able to use our phones without having a teacher yell at you for having it out or taking them away doesn't it sometime get annoying to keep taking phones?,0
"You should allow students to use phones for many reasons. It wouldn't make a difference if they used it during free time. They aren't doing any work at that time so why not let them use their phones. You should think about it. Think about when a kid is going through something hard in school or if something happened, and they disappeared. No one would want that to be their child, and you wouldn't want that to be yours, would you? Cell phones could be distracting but It's for a good cause. A cause to save someone's life. You think about that.",0

"I am considering becoming a computer engineer after high school, so I have done some research into what qualifications and experiences I need to prepare myself for this profession. I have found that a degree in computer science or engineering from an accredited university is highly recommended, as well as the completion of internships or entry-level jobs with technology companies. Additionally, I need to have excellent problem-solving skills, knowledge of coding languages, and the ability to think outside the box. To that end, I am taking some college-level courses in programming and mathematics that will both help me prepare for college and give me a head start on my studies. I am also researching different college programs to find the best fit for me. Furthermore, I plan to pursue leadership roles in school and community organizations, as well as complete relevant volunteer work, so that I can develop more experience and gain skills to help me excel in my chosen career.",1
"I don't think the use of technology to read the emotional expressions of students in a classroom is valuable. Sometimes people don't want others to know how their feeling and why their feeling like that. Also, some people might think it's invading their privacy if they didn't give the person permission to read their emotional expressions.",0
"Reading other peoples emotional expressions without permission can cause the person to get angry because they might not want others to know how their feeling. I think it would be better to see how the person is acting and if you see that they aren't acting the way they usually do then you can ask them how their feeling or if their okay instead of using technology to read someone's emotional expressions. For example, in the text in paragraph 5 it talks about how you can tell how a friend is feeling by the look on their face. Some people don't like others knowing how their feeling because they might think that the person is going to go off and tell others. They might be afraid that their going to make fun of them.",0
"Using technology can give you false information if not used properly. It can read that your happy but in reality you can be sad or angry you just aren't showing it because you don't want others to know. Also, it can read that your sad but in reality you're trying to show people that your happy, so they don't ask you what's wrong. If the person who read your expression through their computer goes up to you and tells you they know that you aren't happy it can make the person feel angry because they were trying so hard not to let people know that they aren't upset.",0
"Sometimes just asking someone in person how their feeling can be better than using technology because nowadays that's all people use, so most people don't communicate in person. Asking someone how they feel can make them feel better if they know they have someone they can talk to and not through technology. Some people can fake their expressions so using technology won't always be as right as asking someone in person how their actually feeling.",0
These are a couple of reasons why I think the use of technology to read peoples emotional expressions isn't valuable to know how someone is feeling.  ,0
"Michelangelo's quote, ""I saw the angel in the marble and carved until I set him free,"" highlights the importance of having a strong mindset and setting high standards for oneself. This quote suggests that success comes from seeing the potential within oneself and working towards achieving it. In order to reach difficult goals, one must develop a strong mindset and a positive attitude towards success.",1
Successful people are those who have developed these traits and have used them to their advantage. They have set high standards for themselves and have worked tirelessly towards achieving them. They have also developed a strong mindset that allows them to overcome obstacles and setbacks. This mindset is often rooted in a belief in their own abilities and a willingness to take risks in order to achieve their goals.,1
"On the other hand, those who struggle to reach their goals often lack these traits. They may not have a clear vision of what they want to achieve or may not believe in their own abilities. They may also lack the determination and resilience necessary to overcome obstacles and setbacks. This can lead to a negative attitude towards success, which can further hinder their ability to achieve their goals.",1
"Positive thinking is a key component of success. Those who have a positive attitude towards success are more likely to take action towards achieving their goals. They are also more likely to overcome obstacles and setbacks, as they view them as opportunities for growth and learning. On the other hand, those with a negative attitude towards success may give up easily and may not be motivated to take action towards achieving their goals.",1
"In order to develop these traits, one must focus on setting high standards for themselves and working towards achieving them. This may involve taking risks and stepping outside their comfort zone. It may also involve developing a strong mindset that allows them to overcome obstacles and setbacks. This mindset can be developed through practicing self-reflection, seeking feedback from others, and learning from past failures.",1
"In conclusion, Michelangelo's quote highlights the importance of having a strong mindset and setting high standards for oneself in order to achieve success. Successful people have developed these traits and have used them to their advantage.

Phones and Driving,0
"Phones have become such an integral part of today's society in such a small amount of times. To the point where it is now considered surprising to not have one of these handheld devices. People are able to contact their family from miles away, check up on the weather, and even entertain themselves on their by watching videos or playing games. However, it isn't all good. Phones become entertaining to the point of distraction. Most of the world having to come up with new rules and laws for these devices and anything like them. 26% of the population getting into car accidents from being distracted by their phones from texting ('How Many Car Accidents Are Caused by Cellphones?' by Bay and Associates). Question is, should drivers be able to use their phones while driving in any capacity? Especially with the rise of their popularity and use with each generation?",0
"Phones should be continued to be used by drivers in most capacities. Not everything should be allowed to continue or be taken off of the law, like the use of any social media or texting for example, because a phone has more uses than that. Texting if obviously the main thing we blame car accidents on, but sometimes it's more than that. Social media platforms can lead to distractions as well. Snapchat, a picture/video media platform led to a girl taking a photo in her car only to crash not even 20 minutes later back in April 2019 ('Teen who drove 106mph, used Snapchat in crash that killed friend is going to prison.' by Noah Fat). While things like that are horrible they shouldn't be banned completely while driving. If someone gets lost on their road they can always use Google Maps to get back home to said person's families. Maybe a family member or close friend is having an emergency, medical or otherwise, and tries to call up that person, but they can't say anything due to their phone being banned. Leaving the Family member/friend to be alone or call someone else.",0
"There is also the fact that not all car accidents are caused by texting and driving. Yes. It is a leading cause, but there are plenty of other causes of car accidents ('Top 15 Causes Of Car Accidents And How You Can Prevent Them.' by Elizabeth Liza King). There are the causes that are more human error. There is distracted driving, drinking and driving, speeding, running a red light, etc. Then there are the more natural causes that could happen to even the most innocent, careful and law-abiding citizens. Rain and potholes being a good couple of them. Just imagine driving in the rain at night and up the street is a pothole that you can barely make out. Oh, but there could be a solution to these problems to reduce car crashes! Ban all of them. A good idea on paper, but impossible to do and succeed without any car accidents ever again. Obviously you can't ban rain from open roads, and car accidents caused by drinking happens more often than not.",0
"Alcoholic influence and texting are two very different things. Both should be banned from driving, but banning your phone completely when driving is similar to banning a couple of bottles in the back of the car and getting in trouble for that. Even though you aren't touching them or plan on using it for later use outside the car. The percentage of car accidents while drinking and driving being 28% ('Motor Vehicle Safety' by Centers for Disease Control and Prevention). Meanwhile, texting and driving being only 26%. A 2% difference. Still both very dangerous things. Yet drinking and driving still isn't banned completely. Yes, it's against the law, but you are allowed to drive after a couple of drinks as long as your Blood Alcohol Concentration stays at 0.08 at the maximum ('Alcohol & Drug Info: What is BAC?' by Stanford University: Office of Alcohol Policy and Education).",0
"Phones as an entirety shouldn't be completely banned as long as alcohol isn't completely banned. Texting/messaging while driving should still be a concern, and shouldn't be reconsidered at all, but not everything is bad on a phone while driving. Coming into this new generation of drivers, it would be a good idea to start coming up with ways to possibly integrate these devices into driving tactics or the car itself. This way, it's possible to still get a use of a phone as well as lowering the car crash rate worldwide. Many cars coming up with this type of hands-free technology. Jeep being a good example of this.  ",0
"Dear Senator,",1
"I am writing to express my support for the Electoral College in the United States presidential election. After reading various articles and analyzing the pros and cons of the Electoral College, I have come to the conclusion that it is the most effective and fair way to elect the President of the United States.",1
"One of the main arguments in favor of the Electoral College is that it ensures that smaller states have a voice in the election. If the president were elected by popular vote, candidates would only focus on campaigning in the most populous states, ignoring the needs and concerns of smaller states. This would lead to a lack of representation for these states and their citizens.",1
"Furthermore, the Electoral College ensures that the president is elected with a broad base of support. A candidate must win a majority of electoral votes, which means they must appeal to voters in various regions of the country. This ensures that the president is not just popular in one area, but has support from a diverse group of voters.",1
"While some argue that the Electoral College can lead to a candidate winning the presidency without winning the popular vote, this has only happened a few times in history. Additionally, in these cases, the candidate still had to win a majority of electoral votes, which means they had broad support across the country.",1
"In conclusion, I strongly believe that the Electoral College is the best way to elect the President of the United States. It ensures that smaller states have a voice in the election, and that the president is elected with broad support from across the country. I urge you to support the Electoral College and to reject any proposals to change to a popular vote system.",1
Thank you for your time and consideration.,1

"Okay, here's my essay:",1
"Hey, guys! Today we're talking about this super deep statement, ""Your character will be what yourself choose to make it."" It's like, think about it, do we really have control over who we are and how we act? Or are we just puppets on a string, influenced by everyone and everything around us? I mean, I know I definitely don't always make the best choices, but I guess that's just who I am, right?",1
"So, on one hand, I think it's totally possible that the people we surround ourselves with can shape us into who we are. Like, if you're hanging out with a bunch of super responsible people, you might start to become more responsible too. Or if you're always around people who are super mean, you might start to be mean too. It's like, you're learning from the people around you and absorbing their traits and behaviors.",1
"But on the other hand, I think we also have a say in whom we want to be. Like, if you want to be a super responsible person, you can choose to do things that will help you become that way, even if your friends aren't. It's like, you have the power to make choices and shape your own character, even if you're influenced by others.",1
"So, I think it's a mix of both. Like, we're definitely influenced by the people around us, but we also have the power to choose who we want to be and how we want to act. It's not just one or the other, it's both. And that's pretty cool, because it means we have the power to shape our own identities and become the people we want to be.",1
"Anyway, that's my two cents on the matter. What do you guys think? Do you think we're totally at the mercy of those around us, or do we have some say in who we are? Let me know in the comments!",1
"Bye, guys! 😃",1

"Students should be required to perform community service because its helps them realize what the real world is like. Also, because some kids just think about themselves so if they go out and help someone less fortunate as them then they will take a whole new look on the world.",0
"To begin with if kids do community service it will help them realize what the world is really like. For example last year I had no plan to get a job or go to college because I had no sense of what the real world is like. But then I was involved in a little program that our school does called kids in the community, and we went and did all kinds of community service, but the one memory that sticks in my mind is when we went to the soup kitchen. I was talking to some people in there and there plans as a little kid were just like mine.",0
"It made me realize that I don't want to end up like them without a home, family, and friends I want to live in a great big home and have a great big family.",0
"Secondly it will give the students a whole new look on the world. I know that my experience will never leave me and I will never go back to my old ways of thinking. I remember that in the seventh grade all I thought about was myself, but now all I think about is helping others and seeing what I could do for my teachers.",0
To sum this whole letter up I know that you will make the right decision and require the students to do at least a few hours of community service because it changed my life and I know it will change the life of a few others.  ,0
"Seeking multiple opinions when asking for advice is beneficial because it allows you to gain different perspectives on your situation or problem. Each person you talk to likely has had different experiences than you and sees the world from their unique viewpoint. By hearing what more than one person has to say, you can get a well-rounded understanding of your options rather than just one narrow view. ",1
"For example, let's say you're debating whether to accept a new job offer or stay in your current role. If you only spoke to one friend, they may be biased based on their own career path and push you towards the choice they personally made. However, if you talked to several trusted colleagues and friends, you'd get input from people at different stages in their careers. Somebody early in their career may encourage the new opportunity for more experience, while someone more senior may advise staying put for stability. Considering opinions from multiple vantage points ensures you don't miss important factors in your decision from only seeing it one way.",1
"Furthermore, different people are likely to point out aspects of each choice that you may not have thought of on your own. Even those close to you don't have access to your exact thoughts and likely missed key details. The more perspectives you hear, the more complete a picture you'll develop of both options. Someone could note a downside that had not occurred to you or draw a link between your situation and experiences of theirs that proved instructive. The accumulation of unique insights and feedback from varied advisers helps guarantee you make the choice fully aware of both its pros and cons. ",1
"In conclusion, seeking counsel from multiple trusted individuals provides a well-rounded perspective that allows for a more informed decision. You gain different viewpoints, uncover factors you may have overlooked alone and end up with a clearer picture of your options to choose the best path forward. While any one person's advice could be biased or incomplete, considering input from several sources helps ensure you make the choice you'll feel most confident about in the long run.",1
"Dear Principal,",0
"I have heard that you are considering not allowing students on an athletic team participate if they have lower than a B. That is a horrible idea. The school budget is being voted down time after time, and you are considering taking hundreds of dollars out of the schools the biggest source of income? Money is not the only problem either.",0
"When kids who care more about athletics than education have to keep their grades up they do try harder, that is true. But you can't expect these students to get nothing lower than a B. When these kids are kicked off the team for getting an above average grade they will give up on academics because they feel that they're hardest isn't good enough. If they had to get a C or above that would make more sense but to ask for all of these kids to get into honors while still participating in after school sports is absurd. Not only will this hurt the schools grade average, but it will hurt the schools' wallet!",0
"For some sports teams you have to pay over one hundred dollars. If you threaten to kick kids off the team if they don't get a grade that would be extremely hard to obtain, they won't pay hundreds of dollars if they even think there is a possibility of being kicked off the team before they have played a lot than they won't pay! It would make more sense to put a slightly lower grade that they have to meet because than the kids will see they have a bigger chance of reaching that goal. You are on the right track but don't go overboard!",0
"A problem that seems to be making a lot of headlines these days is out of shape kids. If we want to have any positive effect on this problem, don't take the one thing standing in the way of kids becoming unhealthy away. RELATIVE_NAME, a doctor at the department of student welfare, had a comment to add,"" Kids who don't play sports don't exercise. That is being proven more and more as kids begin to think it is more fun to stay inside than to play outside."" To keep kids healthy you must preserve sports, the only thing motivating the, to stay active.",0
"Grades will go down, students will become unhealthy, and the school will lose money. All of these will be the result of making sports harder to stay on. Don't make a healthy, intelligent school a failure because of a bad decision!",0

"Did you know that the human touch is very important to the human brain? Human touch lets the brain know that you're still alive and breathing. It will let the brain know that their body will always be okay and that they are in safe hands. Without human touch, you or anyone else, could die. Students may experience enormous mental health problems, but they should at least try to participate because students will become healthier through human interactions, and they can use these activities for future references.",0
"Any student can become healthier through small activities, here's why. These kids will become more social with each other, and they may end up making friends. Even if this activity requires the tiniest conversation, the brain is becoming more active and is not being isolated in its own thoughts. Students will come in contact with sports through this process. Sports would be a great way to become healthy. A body requires physical exercise, this will help with the vitamins that your body needs throughout the years. Students will be able to think in a more imaginative way. This opens another part of your brain which may have never been used before. This will help you imagine fun things for a ""get away"" space! Any extracurricular activity can help your students in a healthy way.",0
"These kids will have rough times throughout their lifetime. These activities will help them through their scenario today! Students will have more experience if a future problem gets in their way. The, now grown up, student can reference their past extracurricular activity. They will be able to think more clearly and will be able to get past their real life problem. Students can use certain extracurricular activities for community service projects. In their future, community service will be very important to college applications. They can use these hours as an example for this future application. Students can think back to their activity and think about the good times that they might have had there. This will make them smile at the experience they had in high school. It will leave a permanent smile on their face whenever they think of their school. Everyone will have fun yet different scenarios they can look back on and use for future references.",0
"Some kids might have a spiraling and out of control mental health situation. If that is a big problem, then they should not have to do the extracurricular activity. Anything having to do with mental to physical pain should be taken seriously at all times. The smallest thing may be able to bigger this emotion. If this student wants to do an activity, you should let them! Anyone with mental health and physical pain issues can try new things which includes after school activities, just take things a bit slow and see how it goes!",0
"Students may experience mental health issues, but you should at least let them try to participate because, these students will become healthier, and they will have this for future references! Even though kids may have these issues, that doesn't mean they can't try. Anything can be healthy in its a own way, shape, and form! I think that you should make the kids at least have one after school activity but only to an extent.  ",0
"Today, the majority of humans own and operate cell phones on a daily basis. People do a lot of things with cellphone, but they should never be able to use phones while driving a vehicle. There are many reasons why you shouldn't. Car crashes, running red lights, and death.",0
"First is car crashes. Car crashes are very common, sometimes it can be because people don't know how to drive, but they are mostly caused because of people looking down at their phone instead of looking at the road. These are liabilities because you can really hurt someone or even take their life. Texting and social media are taking all the attention away from you looking at the road. Why not be smart and just put the phone down for a few minutes and just relax and drive. It can save a life",0
"Next is running red lights. Think about all the things that can happen if you run a red light. A major ticket, a bad crash, and even a life. Just all the bad things that can happen. Just putting the phone down can prevent all the bad things that can happen to you and your loved ones. Say your driving on a major highway, maybe I-95, there is an intersection in the middle of the road, and you need to see the red light because its about to turn. If you're looking at your phone and miss the light you can cause a major disturbance in traffic.",0
"Last is death, Think about how many people you can kill in a car crash. You're driving and you pick up your phone and miss a turn, you hit a car and that car hits 5 more cars and sets off a chain reaction, All of those people have a probability of dying because of how fast your going and how hard you hit them. Now you can be charged with murder and that gives you life in prison. So think about that before picking up your phone.",0
In conclusion all of this reason are why you should not be able to use your phone while driving.  ,0
"The President of the United States is one of the most powerful political leaders in the world and controls the faith of one of the wealthiest countries the planet. There have been many discussions on how to elect the president of such a great nation. The Electoral College, the founding fathers established it in the constitution as a compromise between election of the president by a popular vote of qualified citizens. If It's worked for over 200 years why change it. The Electoral College provides certainty of outcome and avoids run-off elections and should be kept as the form of election of the U.S. president of our state.",0
"To Begin With, the Electoral College has been used for more than 200 years and our state is fighting for another 200 years of electoral college. In an article by Richard A. Poster called ""In Defense Of The Electoral College:Five Reasons To Keep Our Despised Method Of Choosing President"" he states ""there are...reasons for retaining the Electoral College despite its lack of democratic pedigree: all are practical reasons, not liberal or conservative reasons.""  Amongst these reasons one of them is the certainty of outcome and in source 3 paragraph 18 it states that ""A dispute over the outcome of an Electoral College vote is possible-it happened in 2000-but It's less likely than a dispute over the popular vote. The reasons are that the winning candidates share of the popular vote."" Richard Poster is stating that Electoral College is more effective because it causes less trouble and does not need to be disputed unlike popular vote which needs to be disputed because the winning candidates share of the Electoral college invariably exceeds his share of the popular vote.",0
"Furthermore, The electoral college avoids the problem of elections in which no candidate receives a majority of the votes cast. In an article by Richard A. Poster called ""In Defense Of The Electoral College:Five Reasons To Keep Our Despised Method Of Choosing President"" he says ""Nixon in 1968 and Clinton in 1992 both had only a 43 percent plurality of the popular votes, while winning a majority in the Electoral College (301 and 370). There is pressure for run off elections when no candidate wins a majority of the votes cast; the presidential election process, is reduced by the electoral college, which invariably produces a clear winner.""",0
"It is essential for students to understand ideas and concepts, more so than to learn facts. To clarify, understanding a concept involves being able to think about it and draw meaningful connections between ideas. On the other hand, learning facts is simply the rote memorization of information. ",1
"Though facts are important, particularly to develop an understanding of the world, ideas and concepts are more essential to success in life. For example, understanding concepts such as how to think critically or how to problem-solve is more beneficial to students than memorizing facts. Consider a student who is presented with a difficult math problem. She may be able to remember the correct calculation, but if she does not understand the underlying mathematical concepts, she will not be able to solve similar problems in the future. In this regard, it is far more beneficial for her to understand the concepts at hand, rather than simply memorizing the calculations.",1
"Furthermore, understanding concepts can be useful beyond immediate applications. For instance, if a student learns and understands the concept of the scientific method, she will be better equipped to apply it in any field that requires research and experimentation. In contrast, if the student simply memorizes the steps of the scientific method, she is likely to forget them in the future, or not recognize when to apply them.",1
"In addition, understanding concepts encourages critical thinking and creativity. For example, when presented with a challenging problem, a student who understands the concept may be able to develop an innovative solution, as opposed to someone who simply remembers facts. Furthermore, understanding concepts prepares students to think abstractly and draw meaningful connections between ideas. In this way, students who understand concepts will be better equipped to thrive in the ever-changing world of the 21st century. ",1
"In conclusion, understanding concepts is significantly more important for students than learning facts. Not only does this give them a better chance of success in the future, but it also encourages critical thinking and creativity. By equipping students with these skills, we are ensuring that they have the tools necessary to address the complex challenges of the future.",1
"Dear senator, the system we have today used to elect the president, the Electoral College, must be changed.  Instead, we should elect the president by means of a popular vote.  The Electoral College is necessary and complicated, and not to mention, outdated.  Source 1 says that the Electoral College was established in the Constitution by the founding fathers.  This begs the question, how can a system, so old still be practical and in use today?  This system, therefore, needs to be replaced by a national popular vote.",0
"There are so many things that could go wrong with the Electoral College, such as a tie, in which the decision would go to the House of Representatives.  According to Source 2, if this were to happen, then, ""the single representative from Wyoming, representing 500,000 voters, would have as much say as the 55 representatives from California, who represent 35 million voters.""  This, of course, would not reflect the nation's vote, and would anger millions of people.  If we elected the president by a popular vote, then the chances of this happening would be significantly more slim.",0
"Another flaw of the Electoral College is that even if a presidential nominee won the popular vote, they could still lose the election.  Even though some may argue that this occasion is highly unlikely, this has actually happened twice before, in 1888 and 2000, according to Source 3.  ""It is entirely possible that the winner of the electoral vote will not win the national popular vote... It happened in 2000, when Gore had more popular votes than Bush yet fewer electoral votes.""  This is a major flaw of the Electoral College system, which is very frustrating to millions of people.  Imagine how you would feel if your candidate won the majority of the nation's vote, but still lost the election because of this horrible voting system.  This unfair incidence could be avoided, if only we got rid of the Electoral College, and replaced it with the simple, fair, and straightforward method of the popular vote.",0
"The popular vote is the preferred voting system in the United States.  According to Source 2, ""over 60 percent of voters would prefer a direct election to the kind we have now.""  If this is the preferred voting system, and the Electoral College has so many flaws, why not change to using the popular vote?  It only makes sense.  Not to mention, if the Electoral College were to be thrown out, then maybe more people would come out to vote, which is important. We would then have a more accurate representation of whom the nation wants as their leader.",0
"Some may argue that the Electoral College is a good system of electing the president, that the founding fathers knew what they were doing when they established it, and that it ""produces a clear winner,"" (Source 3.)  But, the information given above disproves these unveiled arguments.  If the Electoral College is such a great system, then why can a nominee who won the majority of the nation's votes still win the election?  Will it always produce a clear winner?  What about the event of a tie?  Or, what about when the ""winner"" did not win the majority of the votes?",0
"In conclusion, the replacement of this flawed system known as the Electoral College by a national popular vote is absolutely necessary.  The people are pushing for a change, and I strongly urge you, senator, to acknowledge this issue.  ",0
"Who knows more, the teacher or the student? That's right, most of the time teachers know more than students except a few prodigies. Teachers are individuals meant to help teach and prepare students for life. A teacher can also help get their students ready for their class by making a summer assignment. These assignments are intended to help students familiarize themselves with the upcoming course they are about to partake in and to keep their young minds active during the break. Teachers have many years of experience, and they fully understand their course and its materials. Therefore, homework given to students in the summer are more beneficial if they are made by the educators because teachers will include all necessary material the student needs to help prepare them for class; teachers will design the review so that it can be used by all students; additionally, teachers can build up or revise their review based on feedback of former students",0
"Projects given over the summer are usually big assignments that students dread, however, digesting the contents of project can immensely benefit students because it introduces students to the information they are going to learn over the next year. Teachers who make summer assignments include the information they think is crucial for students to know before they enter the class. An example is an AP World History teacher making students memorize the locations of countries all around the world as a part of their summer assignment. By knowing locations of different countries, students can recall the general area and apply the location to the lesson they are learning about, like the capital of Constantinople and what countries surround it. Teachers may also assign vocabulary words for students to learn. The words in summer assignments are useful because when the specific vocabulary word appears in class, students who did the summer assignment will know the definition and won't get stuck, unlike those who didn't complete the review. Similarly, teachers insist that students are familiar with basic math concepts and the properties of exponents and multiplication before entering algebra 2. By knowing the information teachers ask for, students will work faster without having to pause and ask questions in class.",0
"When teachers make the summer assignment, they create it so that all students can understand, review, and gain knowledge by finishing it. Teachers focus on all students and their way of learning during the process of developing the work; They don't focus on one specific student because that would be unfair to other students. Yes, teachers making customized review for a specific student would help the student tremendously, but that would not accommodate others because it is specific to the one student. A student-designed project would include only the information the former student remembers. Sometimes students don't remember certain crucial topics they learn in class. Establishing the fact students don't remember the whole course, they will leave the topics out of the review which in turn could affect and hurt future students. This could also mean students will create a review based on their style of learning whether it be more artistic or more reading based. Professors and teachers help their students because they have the obligation of educating, unlike students whose jobs are not to make sure other students understand the course material. In short terms, teachers focus on their students and their collective education while students focus on themselves and their individual education.",0
"Over the years of teaching, teachers will be able to receive feedback from former students and revise or build up their review. Summer projects can be designed to focus on the topics that are harder for students as a whole to understand. Through the input of students, teachers will be able to detect the harder subject and include practice for the difficult topic in the summer assignment. Students may also suggest ways to make the review more fun or resourceful. Teachers will sort through and determine which methods of review are most abundant when it comes to the material by considering the students' recommendations. Trial and error over time will help teachers create the most effective summer assignment for students and in turn help both parties.",0
"Summer assignments created and designed by teachers will help students and teachers themselves in the upcoming semester through the knowledge they have of their students and their learning habits. Teachers are there to help all their students and part of the way they help students is through the preparation for their upcoming course and through the review of essential skills for class. By helping their students with review, they complete a portion of their goal to make students successful in school and in life. ",0
My claim for using the technology is great thing. Do you use technology every day of your life? It could help kids out by making them interested in about what they are learned. The technology could tell what old paintings of people in the old times and tell them watt hey were feeling. I think it is a great technology improvement to the world.,0
"The FACS could help kids when they are getting board of the school work, and it could change it where they get more involved in it. The technology could make the kid do better in school if they lair then material differently that other. If a kid gets board of his work and the computer that he is working on changes the way he lairs it in a better way and a more fun way to learn the material.",0
"The technology could tell what percent of each emotion the old painting had. Just like the Mona Lisa was feeling like she was 83 percent happy, 9 percent disgusted, 6 percent fearful, and 2 percent angry. If we could figure out what all the paint of people and what they were feeling. This could tell us a lot about the person we were learning about.",0
"This technology could change the life of the world. It could help us what percent of people were happy, sad, disgusted, fearful, and angry. It could tell us why we had all the war and what the Leader were thing when they started the war. This technology could figure out why we had all the problems we had in the past. The technology could change the way video games work or video surgery.",0
These are the reason why I think we should have the technology. People could learn different way on how to do thing and kids wouldn't get tired of school. The technology help a lot of the world and teaches them how you can use it later in life. Could learn about what past people felt and figure out what happen in the past. I don't see why people think technology ID bad because if help with everything in our life and teaches using our rescues. Would you agree with me on my claim why we should have this technology?,0
Well In this part I think is good and bad idea.,0
"I think is good because if they have any emergency in home they do not going to dismiss any classes they can take classes from home they have already tools do not needed to go outside they have everything in home, and the teacher they do not need to wake up early every day, and also some family they are going to agree because now they do not are going to think every time how is my daughter or my son if they are safe or if they are in trouble.",0
"The bad things that if they're going to give to all the students to take classes from only or video confederation some students they're not going to do their work. In some others parts they do not have any internet or money to buy a computer they do not have opportunity that the others' person have, also the teacher do not have any jobs they are going to need they work back, and some family they do not need to send to school to their sons because they do not have many, or they want their son to work. Is very different to have the people think is hard to take decision.",0
"If they are old they can choose what they want, they have to think very careful if they said yes they want to take class form online, is going to be easier from them because they do not have a job, or they do not have to take care, they can do it they have a lot of time in the world if they do not have any computer that's is going to be a perfect problem form them because they do not have school open, or they do not have the materials they want for learn, they have to look for job but sometimes if you're looking for a job they need to know how you was in school they need to see you record, you are going to need in the future.",0
"If you are going to say no because we need to learn something, we do not have any money to pay to go to school theirs so many ways to go to school there have school that are free you do not need to pay anything, just you need is go to school every day, and do not get in trouble. Is good idea if they do this in college for students they work they know, they have more responsibility.",0
"If you put a child with computer is going to be more concentrated in computer, and maybe they're going to have problems with their eyes or any problem when their growth up.",0
"If is an old is easier from them because they brain is more they can understand, and they do not have any issues to work in the computers.",0
"So is bad idea that they students take class form online they do not have any money, or they do not work. ",0
"School is the last place a student wants to be in when they've experienced a couple of rough days or even weeks and home is the first place they think about when they need comfort or rest. Similarly, not all students are carbon copies. Different students require different paces regarding social life and academics. So why would schools reject the needs of their variety of students? Students should have access to long distance learning where they will attend classes online and where they will study in a safe, familiar environment that they already perform better in as place they can focus.",0
"Firstly, the internet and modern technology's first purpose is to make our lives better. This is the direction the today's world is headed. Teachers loath the phrase ""I forgot it at home."" But with the ease of online classes, students will not be able to use the same excuses. Teachers also will not have to worry about misplaced papers when all the materials will be conveniently saved online. But some opponents believe students will inevitably take advantage of being online, where they are prone to the temptations of plagiarism and where they can find the answer key to every worksheet they've ever been handed. But why would a student take advantage of the World Wide Web at home when they have all the time in the world to complete their assignments and where they already perform better on their homework? Stooping grades will become the first wake-up call for students taking advantage of the ease of modern technology.",0
"Secondly, in favor of many parents and guardians, home is not only more comfortable for students, it is also much safer. Avoiding more traumatizing events of physical and verbal bullying on school grounds will significantly increase the child's chances of performing at their best in academic as well as extracurricular activities. Even with some efforts to eradicate the event of school shootings with metal detectors and other techniques, students are ultimately safer at home rather than on the schools vulnerable campus.",0
"Some opponents say a is inevitable for a students social life to diminish when they do not have face-to-face contact with their teachers or peers. However, being at home more often will instinctively encourage students to venture out of their familiar environment and seek beneficial relationships with other students. The group video conferences that will be provided by online programs will give students the tools they need to interact with their teachers and have meaningful discussions about their academics and improvement.",0
"Similarly, some students choose not to interact with their teachers they see on a daily basis at school on a more meaningful level where they should be developing better relationships with them. Email, video conferences, and other ways of communicating from home will provide this for students at home. Instead of constantly seeing them in school hallways and in class, the student can choose how they will develop their relationships with and get to know their teachers.",0
"Overall, students should have access to a path of learning that is catered to them. This path should accommodate for teachers and learners ease, safety, and the students social needs. Home is the best place for a student to learn away from the school campus especially when point-blank bullying and mass shootings are taken into consideration. However, the students social life will not be diminished in any way with the aid of group video conferences. The students online academic career will reflect how they learn best. ",0
"The Electoral College is a ""process"" ""between election of the President by a vote in Congress and election of the President by a popular vote of qualified citizens"" (1). The Electoral Collage was created by the founding fathers and was written in the Constitution. The Electoral Collage should be kept instead of popular vote because the Electoral Collage is easier to decide who becomes President, and it is chosen by a better educated person.",0
"To start, the Electoral Collage helps in deciding who is going to be the President.  ""Certainty of outcome, everyone's President, swing states, big states, and avoid run-off elections"" (Poster). The reason is that the winning candidate's share of the Electoral Collage invariably exceeds his share of the popular vote"" (18). ""This is a desirable result because a candidate with only regional appeal is unlikely to be a successful president"" (19). ""...the most thoughtful voters should be the ones to decide the election"" (20). ""So, other things being equal, a large state gets more attention from presidential candidates in a campaign than a small state does..."" (21). ""The Electoral Collage avoids the problem of elections in which no candidate receives a majority of the votes cast"" (22).",0
"Secondly, when voting for Electoral Collage ""you are actually voting for your candidate's electors"" (6). ""Each candidate running for President is your state has his or her own group of electors"" (5). ""The electors are generally chosen by the candidate's political party, but state laws vary on how the electors are selected and what their responsibilities are..."" (5).",0
"Although the Electoral Collage sounds simple, there are some problems that occur. ""... According to a Gallup poll in 2000, taken shortly after Al Gore--thanks to the quirks of the electoral collage-- won the popular vote but lost the presidency, over 60 percent of voters would prefer a direct election to the kind we have now"" (9). ""Under the electoral collage system, voters vote not for the president, but for a slate of electors, who in turn elect the president"" (10).",0
"To conclude, the Electoral Collage is easier to decide who is becomes the President, and it is chosen by a better educated person. ""Voters in a presidential elections are people who want to express a political preference rather than people who think that a single vote may decide an election..."" (23).",0
"I believe that adopting a vegetarian or vegan diet is a good idea. There are many reasons for this. First, it is better for the environment. Livestock farming is a major cause of deforestation, greenhouse gas emissions, and water pollution. By eating less meat, we can reduce our carbon footprint and help protect the planet.",1
"Second, a vegetarian or vegan diet is healthier. Studies have shown that people who eat less meat have lower rates of heart disease, diabetes, and certain types of cancer. This is because plant-based diets are typically lower in saturated fat and cholesterol and higher in fiber, vitamins, and minerals.",1
"Finally, adopting a vegetarian or vegan diet can help reduce animal cruelty. Many animals are raised in cramped and unsanitary conditions, and are subjected to inhumane treatment. By choosing to eat less meat, we can reduce the demand for these products and encourage more humane farming practices.",1
"In conclusion, I believe that adopting a vegetarian or vegan diet is a good idea for many reasons. It is better for the environment, healthier, and helps reduce animal cruelty. While it may be difficult to give up meat entirely, even small changes in our diet can make a big difference.",1
"The author of ""The Challenge of exploring Venus."" Did a bad job of supporting his claims that we should study Venus despite the danger that presents. His information was plentiful it games us a good idea on what he believes and what's happening to further their opinion. Unfourtanely it didn't provide us with enough good follow-up supports.",0
"First off with his first and second reasons being astronomers are fascinated by Venus due to the possibility of it being it earth like previously and that's It's still has some earth like features. This is stated in paragraph four as it states ""Astronomers are fascinated by Venus because it may well once have been the most Earth-like planet in our solar system. Long ago, Venus was probably covered largely with oceans and could have supported various forms of life, just like Earth."" and ""Astronomers are fascinated by Venus because it may well once have been the most Earth-like planet in our solar system. Long ago, Venus was probably covered largely with oceans and could have supported various forms of life, just like Earth."" Despite these good points he doesn't further it more in paragraph four he only states that it can be our nearest option for a planetary which adds nothing to the claim and doesn't a good follow up of what they said previously.",0
"His third reason is in paragraph 8 the last paragraph, and it is""Striving to meet the challenge presented by Venus has value, not only because of the insight to be gained on the planet itself. This is a perfect claim, but the author only follows it up with human curiosity will just lead us into equally intimidating endeavors which adds pretty much nothing in regard to his claim. Paragraph 8 is the final paragraph and it's a horrible placement to put your final reasoning.",0
"Overall the author reasons are good, but it lacks any follow-up support to back it up. While giving information for context is great the author over did it, and it took up the majority of the paragraphs leaving no room to put some of their reasons in more early paragraphs to catch the readers' attention. Many follow up to their reasons added nothing to the authors claim making it unless information. It wouldn't have been so bad if the author had made it less an info dump and more reasoning to help their claim.",0
"I disagree with the principal's decision to require all students to participate in at least one extracurricular activity. While extracurricular activities provide many benefits, forcing participation removes student choice and can overburden some students. ",1
"Not all students have the time or interest for extracurriculars. Some students juggle jobs, family responsibilities or intensive academic schedules that leave little room for additional commitments. Forcing activities on these students could negatively impact their stress levels and performance in other areas. It's unrealistic and unfair to expect every student to take on yet another obligation.",1
"Extracurricular activities are most valuable and meaningful when students participate because they genuinely want to, not because they are obligated to. Forcing participation may discourage some students who lack interest or skill in any available options. They may half-heartedly join an activity just to fulfill the requirement rather than finding an activity they truly enjoy. As a result, they would not gain the full benefits of extracurricular engagement such as learning time management, developing talents and having fun. ",1
"Instead of requiring universal participation, the school should continue to strongly encourage involvement and promote the wide variety of options available, so students can discover their own interests. The school could spotlight different activities each month and recognize top participants. For students who cannot join an activity due to other obligations, alternative ways of earning credit like volunteering could be allowed. This retains student choice while still cultivating school spirit and involvement from those who are able.",1
"In conclusion, while extracurricular activities offer numerous benefits, mandatory participation risks overburdening students and missing the key benefits of voluntary engagement. The school should focus on promoting involvement through positive encouragement rather than compulsion. This balanced approach considers individual student circumstances and respects their autonomy to participate in ways most meaningful to them.",1
"Imagine a classroom fill with students using their cellphones. What do you think they are really using their cellphones for? Some students do not really use their cellphones for educational purposes but use it as an excuse to wonder off and get distracted with it. Students should not be granted permission by any teacher to use their cellphones in class, it is a mistake.",0
"A major distraction nowadays is social media. Instagram, Snapchat, and YouTube have impacted the fastest generations. When teacher allow their student to use their phones most of them at times just login into Instagram or Snapchat. It can easily be proven by the amount of students that come after class and tell their teacher they could not complete their classwork. Social media can be a weapon in and out of school, it will distract students from their work.",0
"Social media isn't the only distraction a student can have from completing class work. I've notice that student at my high school download these new games on their cellphones. When a teacher of mine tells us to pull out our cellphones to do some research, I see more than half the class flip their phones and start to play this new game called Fortnite. This game is very addictive that those students who decided to play when asked to do research, their grades dropped straight down to a failing grade. This is why allowing students to use their cellphones can be a mistake, they are failing their courses.",0
"Texting your friends during class is the last distraction for a student. Students during class might've been waiting for so long to text their friends back. Most of the time it's really not more of a ""hey"" or ""how are you doing?"". Students really have long conversations and get carried along that they forget what they were asked to use their cellphones for. High schoolers are always just on their phones texting one another and wait until last minute or the last day an assignment is due. Texting can be the worst distraction for students and this is why they should not be allowed to use cellphones for ""educational purposes"".",0
"In conclusion, schools should prohibit teacher granting permission to student to use cellphones during class. Cellphones can be distracted, and it will allow many students to fail courses or not complete assignments. Students spend more time on social media, games, and texting their friends more than doing homes works or even reading a book.",0
"Some schools require students to complete summer projects to assure they continue learning during their break. Should these summer projects be teacher-designed or student-designed? Many people believe that projects should be teacher-designed but I do not. I believe during summer the projects students will do should be student-designed. They should be student-designed because more students will be into actually doing it then putting it off and never getting to it, students can have fun while doing a project, and they don't have to be forced into doing a boring project a teacher chooses.",0
"First, more students will be into it. If a student does a project on their favorite movie, superhero, celebrity, etc. they will have more fun doing that. Let's say a teacher told their students to do a project on Abraham Lincoln, the students probably wouldn't be very happy about that. However, if a teacher told their students to do a project on their favorite TV show, then I'm sure that students would actually be excited about it.",0
"Secondly, students can have fun while learning. If they did a project on their favorite movie, they could watch that movie and tell the class and teacher about all the funny, happy, and sad moments. You could also learn a lot of history by doing a project on your favorite movie, because you'll have to learn about the history on why they made the movie.",0
"Third, they don't have to be forced into dong a boring project a teacher chooses. Nobody ever wants to write a paper on history and wars. If the students got to choose about what their project could be on it would be a lot better and easier to get a student to actually do it. If you tell a student to do a project on World War 1, chances are they won't do it, or they will put it off until the last minute. A student could actually be excited to do a project if they got to choose what it was about.",0
"In conclusion, Some schools require students to complete summer projects to assure they continue learning during their break. I believe during summer the projects students will do should be student-designed. They should be student-designed because more students will be into actually doing it then putting it off and never getting to it, students can have fun while doing a project, and they don't have to be forced into doing a boring project a teacher chooses. ",0
The 'Face' in Space,0
"The Face is a bona fide example of a natural landform. However, some people say that it is an ancient artifact that proves that there is life on Mars. Scientists have said that the Face is just another battle or Martian mesa, that the Face is just another natural landform and there isn't a face at all. It is just a common landform.",0
"Even if the masses aren't satisfied, the Face will remain just a battle or Martian mesa. Martian mesas are common enough around Colonia, the place where the Face was found. The Face only has shadows that make it appear like a face. Conspiracy theorists say that the Face might be evidence of ancient civilization on Mars, but defenders of NASA's budget beg to differ.",0
"Truly, the face is just a natural landform.",0
"As the text states ""There wasn't an alien monument after all."" The passage also reads that Main sent a team to capture a more clear picture of the Face. Some said that there might have been hidden alien markings, and they were proven wrong. The Mars Global Surveyor drew close enough to get a clear picture of the Face. As it turns out, there really wasn't an alien monument after all.",0
"In the beginning, there was no face to begin with. The Face only had unusual shadows that made it look like a face. NASA unveiled the image for everyone to see and here in the passage it reads ""huge rock formation...which resembles a human head...formed by shadows giving the illusion of eyes, nose and mouth."" This shows that there wasn't a face, just an illusion.",0
"There is the argument that the Face is evidence of an ancient civilization. At the time the picture of the Face was taken, it was winter. Perhaps the alien markings were hidden by the cloudy haze. Mission controllers even looked again. On a cloudless, summer day, the Mars Global Surveyor drew close enough to take the another picture, in hope there was something that they didn't see. Even so, the scientists were proven right again. The Face was really a mesa, a landform common in Colonia.",0
"In conclusion, the Face turned out to be a common landform. Just another battle, another landform, another rock formation, not really a face at all. There is no evidence that there was even a civilization and there wasn't even evidence that there was life to begin with! Again, there could have been alien markings that were covered by the haze, and there could have been life on Mars. Let us face the facts though; in this reality; there isn't a face on Mars, there isn't a civilization on Mars, and it is just another landform. ",0
Introduction in my opinion kids should not stay after school to do extracurricular activities. I don't think kids would be happy or satisfied about having to stay after school. A lot of kids don't have the time or energy to stay after school. In my personal bias I don't enjoy staying after school because I like to play video games with my friends.,0
Some kids don't enjoy staying after school,0
"When kids stay after school they decide to make that decision, so they can stay with their friends or make friends. A lot of kids who don't stay after school do stuff outside of school they already might be participating in sports or just hanging out with their friends outside of school. What the principal offered to the students was not a popular choice with the students not all kids can draw, run or debate and think well.",0
Kids would get mad that they might have to stay after,0
"Let me get into more detail about how kids would react if they had to stay after school. Kids, all over social media probably making dun of the school for deciding to make that decision. They would call it stupid and bad words because they would not be happy about that concept. The students would probably not stay after school because they would not want to stay after school",0
Kids have trouble making groups if you try to stay after school for a sport and try to join a group they will kick you out. Students like to exclude people that are inferior to them and relevant people. I have been through exclusion before it's not a good feeling. Being in a club that you don't know anyone makes it worse. When you have no one to make a group with its very awkward and shaming. Kids are cruel and savages there are not a lot of nice kids around.,0
Conclusion,0
"In conclusion, I do not think that kids should not stay after school or forced to stay after school. In reality kids don't really care for that stuff at all. Kids can be mean and savages and can exclude people. Kids with no friends will have trouble having fun if their going to sit by themselves.",0
"The author suggest that studying Venus is a worthy pursuit because, venue have been the most like earth planet in our solar system. they believe that long ago Venus was probably cover with large oceans and could have supported various forms of life, just like earth.""Venus can sometimes be the nearest option for a planetary visit, a crucial consideration given the long time frames of space travel"". NASA has been thinking of many ideas to help humans explore Venus, possible solution to the hostile condition on the surface of Venus would allow scientist to float above the fray of Venus. Bump like medical hovering over 30 or so miles above the roiling Venusian landscape. Like a jet airplane travel at higher altitude to fly over many storms, a vehicle hovering over Venus would avoid the deadly ground conditions by staying up and out of the way. Researchers are working on innovations that would allow our machines to last long enough to contribute meaningfully to our knowledge of Venus.",0
"NASA have come up with example of tool that can help build a safe ship for human to travel to Venus. Some simplified electronics made of silicon carbide have been tested in a chamber simulating the chaos of Venus's surface and have lasted for three weeks in Venus conditions. Mecchanical computers which is an old technology might help people explore Venus. Peering at Venus from a ship orbiting or hovering safely far above the planet can provide only limited on ground. Most light cannot penetrate the dense atmosphere, rendering standard forms of photography and videography ineffective.",0
Even though Venus is the close to earth twin there are still many dangers to exploring the planet. The atmosphere contains 97 percent carbon dioxide. The clouds are highly corrosive sulfuric acid in Venus's atmosphere. On Venus surface temperatures average over 800 degrees Fahrenheit. The atmospheric pressure is 90 times greater than what humans experience on our own planet.,0
"The condition on Venus are far more extreme than anything humans can encounter on earth. The environment would crush even a submarine diving to the deepest parts of our oceans. Venus has the hottest surface temperature than any planet. High pressure and heat, Venusian geology and weather present additional impediments like erupting volcanoes. Powerful earthquakes, and frequent lightning strikes to probes seeking to land on its surface.",0
Striving to meet the challenge presented by Venus has value. Because human curiosity will likely lead us into many equally intimidating endeavors. Travelers on earth and beyond should not be limited by danger to explore Venus more. Venus should be expanded to help meet the edges of imagination and innovation.,0
I think that the more NSA works together to make tool to go see MRE of Venus them they will be able to explore more anytime.,0
"Dear TEACHER_NAME, Principal of SCHOOL_NAME,",0
"I believe that everyone wants to have a litter-free community where everyone can live and be safe when exposed to the conditions outdoors. School especially since it is indeed the main occasion where many students are daily spending their days at. With that being said, I would like to let you know that the world would surely be a better place if everyone would cooperate and help out the community by doing community services. When people think about community service, most people would think of punishment; something that juvenile delinquents does as a punishment. That is not the case, however. It is just something that would really help out the world and plays a major role in many lives.",0
My first reason why I truly believe that every child and adult should at least do some community services is because it helps out the world in a major way. Going around the block and picking up little pieces of trash or picking up bottles and recycling it really does help out. One person can truly make a major change. Your neighbors and home where you live in is the main place that should be kept clean so that you would feel safe to go out and not worry about getting sick and such.,0
"Many kids and families in Africa for instance, however does not have a clean environmental economy. Every day they're exposed to many conditions such as diseases, bad fevers, and other conditions affecting their health. When you see how they're living, it's truly a horrible sight to see. On the other hand, America is a much more different society. When everyone cooperates and helps out, you can prevent these things from happening. Our place is much easier to clean than in Africa and all we need to do is contribute. I believe everyone has a good side to themselves even though they don't realize it.",0
"Keeping the world clean is a great thing, but there are also some other community services that you can do. This would be things such as taking care of animals in animal shelters. Every living thing deserves respect and when you show love towards animals, it really makes them understand that even though they have been through a lot in their past, they still have a great future ahead of them. Not only is taking care of animals a great thing, but at the same time you can be having a lot of fun!",0
"So in conclusion, TEACHER_NAME, I know that with the help of everyone from around the world and especially in our community, the world would be a better place. Whether it's from humans to animals, plants to cars, if the world was kept clean and the environment safe, having community service will enable a lot of great things in life!",0
"Sincerely,",0

"Mobile phone use while driving is very common. It is widely considered very dangerous to drive while on your phone. It has been a numerous number of crashes while people have been driving and on a cellphone. Some people might feel that driving while on cellphone is okay, but it has been reported to be illegal. Overall using a cellphone increases driver's risk of causing a crash or death to a family, or person. Drivers are distracted, decreasing the driver's awareness on the road, leading to more crashes.",0
"When driving, sometimes it is difficult to focus on the road which makes it easy to forget that the roads are shared by everyone and not just yourself. Other drivers on the road take notice of drivers on their cellphones whether they want to or not. Driving is a privilege and some people take it for granted.",0
Driving you have to be very careful with yourself and for other drivers. One minute you're here and next your gone because you were on your phone or not paying attention to the road or other drivers that driving on the other side of the road or by you. It is only a matter of seconds before you are dead and gone.,0
"Texting while driving causes a 400 percent increase in time spent with eyes off the road. Of all related tasks, texting is by far the most dangerous activity while driving. Texting while driving is becoming a life-threatening norm for people driving. With inexperienced drivers with lack of skills, cell phones use can especially deadly for teen drivers. It has been many deaths from car crashes while on a cellphone. Adults for the most part can't ever stay of their phones, cause every time I'm driving I see it.",0
"In conclusion because technology will change, and new distractions will be introduced parents need to take action. It isn't a good idea for you to drive while on the phone because it can cause serious danger. Also, parents should avoid calling their teen while he or she is driving. Instead, ask to be called before leaving one place and when arriving at the next destination. A teen may feel attempted to answer a parent's call if received while driving. Stay off your phone while driving, it isn't safe while driving.  ",0
"Is it really, good if u don't use a car day to day? People in Europe have started this new trend of having different suburbs to not have cars. Now, Paris is banning driving due to smog. Also, Colombia now has a car-free day that made people bike, hike and also take buses to work making the streets have less traffic jams. The U.S., one of the most car used nations, has been going down, and in April 2013 the number of miles driven per person was the same as in January 1995. Experts are also thinking that if they encourage people to reduce the usage of cars, that it may help the greenhouse gases problem gradually.",0
"So one suburb that is already been established and made a car-free zone is Vauban, Germany. This suburb has minimal parking spots and people have easy access to stores. A woman said,",0
"""When I had a car I always tense. I'm much happier this way""",0
. This movement of making places car-free is called,0
"""smart planning""",0
". ""In the U.S. the Envoirmantal Protection Agency is promoting",0
"""car reduced""",0
"Communities and legislators are starting to act, if cautiously.""",0
"In Paris, people were fined if they did not leave their car at home. This was put into place, because smog was intensifying. Also, smog is more in Paris than in any other capital in Europe. Delivery companies lost revenue, but electric cars and public transit was free of charge. After, the smog cleared the odd ruling was rescinded.",0
"Colombia had an idea that was put into place one day and made a change in everybody. They made a program which is a car-free day which made people go hiking, biking, and they rode buses to work. It made the streets clearer. It was put into place so that it would help the reduction of smog. This program helps people to know other ways to transport themselves without cars.",0
"The U.S. is the nation that has the most cars used. So, now they are trying to decrease the use of cars. A study showed that driving by young people decreased 23% between 2001 and 2009. Also, people big car business are trying to help. The want to partner with telecommunications, so they can create cities with lower emissions and improved safety.",0
"Over many years, technology has become more and more advanced. Some of this technology has become so far that it can now detect human facial expression and determine what emotion they are expressing. This technology is called Facial Action Coding System (FACS) technology, and it enables computers to identify human emotions. This technology can have a positive impact in school classrooms today. FACS can help improve the way students learn in schools, they way teachers teach their students, and most importantly, help teachers detect when a student is feeling confused.",0
"One of the main positive impacts FACS can have in reading emotional expressions of students in a classroom is improved the way students learn. FACS can scan the facial expressions of the students in the classroom and determined if the majority of the students are confused by the lesson the teacher is teaching. FACS could then modify the lesson in a way that students can understand it and the teacher can then further clarify the lesson the way FACS shows it. As stated in paragraph six, ""Then it could modify the lesson, like an effective human instructor"", this shows how FACS can help teachers in the way they teach. This could also explain to teachers how to clarify even more the lesson to students that may be going through hard times.",0
"Another way FACS can have a great impact in schools all around the country is by improving the way teachers teach their classrooms. FACS can detect many expressions on students in a classroom. It can detect whether a student is perplexed by lesson or simply just bored. FACS can detect which students in the classroom are bored by analyzing their facial expressions. As stated in paragraph six, ""A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored"". FACS can then provide the teacher many ways in which they can make the lesson more interesting so that students can comprehend it better and in a more fun way.",0
"The last way in which FACS can greatly improve the teaching environment in schools is by recognizing when a student is depressed or sad. FACS can detect facial expressions on students faces and determine if they may be going through trouble or are depressed. As stated on paragraph six, ""Most human communication is nonverbal, including emotional communication"". FACS could recognize when a student is not okay so that teachers can the help those students who may need help, whether that is emotional help or help with school work. FACS could even help save lives by getting help to students who may be contemplating suicide.",0
"In conclusion, the Facial Action Coding System can be extremely valuable to schools all around the world. This computer system can help teachers improve the way they teach their classrooms by analyzing students' emotional expressions towards a certain lesson. It can help teachers by modifying their lessons in such a way so that students are not bored or confused by it. Lastly, it can help teachers know which students may be going through hard times and help those who need help.",0
"Dear principal,",0
"I strongly suggest that we have an absolutely no tolerance rule for phones. Phones all over the world everywhere are starting to cause major issues i our society. They have become a huge distraction in schools, homes and even businesses.",0
"Allowing a zero tolerance policy on cell phones I believe can path the way to success for many generations to come. If we continue to let students bring their phone to school scandalous things can happen or continue to happen. With phones in students pockets we have no clue what they could be doing during anytime let alone a test! These students can be sending answers to one another, telling people what on the test, basically anything could happen. I believe if we allow absolutely no phones this won't be happening.",0
"Also, students could be sending inappropriate text messages. Plus with all this new and advanced technology today worse things can be done I ensure you that! Teenagers have been caught with disgusting pictures, depressing chain texts and just texts in general. This horrid thing has to be stopped this cannot go on!",0
"So please help the community and have a zero tolerance policy cell phones. This solution I have come up with can not only help your school but everybody involved. It can help parents, teachers, board members and others. I hope this helps you on your final decision.",0

"I claim that it would be better if the Electoral college would stay the same. And the reason why it should stay the same It's because the way it's been going, but it has been also having some small problems, but they are also reasons why it should stay the same.",0
"The problem is that if you want to vote for president you can't because you are going to have to vote fora least 34 Democratic and they elect the president, not you. And the electors are the ones that are not holding public office. The other problem is that it also depends on the state you are living on because that is it depend son who picks the electors. The ones that mostly pick them are states conventions, party's central committee or even sometimes the presidential candidates themselves.",0
"I claim that it should stay the same because of these reason, Certainty of outcome, in 2000 it was possible that the dispute over the outcome if an Electoral College vote and around the 2012's the election, Obama received a 61.7 percent of the electoral vote compared to only 51.3 percent and that was a lot. Also the college had to restores some weight in the political balance that large states lose by virtue of the MAL apportionment, with the senate decreed in the constitution. There was method that the Electoral college use and that was that to select the president that will turn off the potential voters for a candidate, there are five reasons for retaining the electoral college despite its lack of democratic pedigree.",0
"In passage 3 it says that the Electoral College has consists 538 electors and the majority of 270 electoral votes is required to elect the president and one for each member in the house of representatives plus two for your senators and the presidential election mostly is held or four yeas on the Tuesday after the first Monday in November and I think that is doing a great job one elections, electors, and on picking the president. Also that's why I think it's better if the electoral college stays the same.  ",0
"From Luke's point of view people should go to Seagoing Cowboys program. Because you get to go on adventures, visit many unique places, and to help the nation. In addition, in 1945 World War II was over in Europe, and many countries were in ruins. To help the nation Seagoing Cowboys had food supplies, and animals to help. You should go to Seagoing Cowboys because you can go on adventures, visit many unique places, and to help the nation.",0
"People should go to Seagoing Cowboys because you can go on adventures, visit unique places, and help the nation. In addition, when you go to Seagoing Cowboys you can go on many adventures. For example, you can take a gondola ride in Venice, Italy, a city with streets and waters. In addition, you can also visit many unique places. In paragraph five, you can tour an excavated castle in Crete. On the other hand, the nation is in ruins from World War II, so you can help the nation. For example, Seagoing Cowboys take care of the horses, young cows, and mules that were shipped overseas from the ruins. You should visit the Seagoing Cowboys because you can go on adventures, visit unique places, and help the nation.",0
"People should go to Seagoing Cowboys for three reasons. One to go on adventures. Second you can visit unique places. Finally, you can help the nation from the ruins. Seagoing Cowboys goes on adventures to different countries around the world. In addition, you can also visit unique places around the world too. Also, you can help the nation from the ruins and help animals. You should go to Seagoing Cowboys to experience new things.  ",0
Driverless cars shouldn't be an option or even a car to use. Technology can fail which isn't worth risking lives over. Even though the Google car has driven more than half a million miles without a crash something can fail. These cars use post estimating sensors to control the vehicle. Imagine if one of these sensors got damaged and caused the car to go out of control. The cars seat also vibrate when the car is in danger of backing into an object. How does that give enough time to the driver to realize what is going on. And what danger the drive is in.,0
Car entertainment can also distract the driver if the driver has to take over. Anything can happen why should we trust technology with our lives. People also can get blamed if their car gets in an accident when that person was technically not driving the car. So who would be liable if the car did get into a crash? It's not logical to think that a car has a better reaction time than a real human being. A human can see what is going on before his or her gets in a crash. But now it's the car that irresponsible for always being aware. Have these cars been tested on different terrains? People can drive anywhere but if it's in a different place with no signal how would you drive the car? Im sure the car would need signal o drive. Some places that could shut down and you wouldn't be able to drive the car.,0
"Classes online sound like a good idea, I agree with this idea, but I’m also disagree for some negative reasons and problems, I also think the best way to learn is the classic way, going to the school, so the reasons to why I agree with it, can be the easy way to have more attendance of the students, because some students lose their buses, wake up late, get sick, or also they wake up tire because they also have jobs and don't go to school for that reason, also it can increase some students grades for attendances, and with the online classes they don't going to have that attendance problems, it is also positive for those students who work, because they don't have to worried about their schedules, or worried about their energy for the day, and I'm also agreed, because me as a student in some way fell more comfortable study at home; those are my reasons to why I agree, but I'm also disagreed for some others things, like the students who have problems to learn, some students needs someone to help them in some problems of the class or about other theme, and it's harder for the teacher to explain something specific from a computer, and it's easier to explain at school, in person; also some students don't have the same concentration them others, and make them study at home, can be a problem because at home they can be distracted by a lot of things, like their phone, t. v or some other electronic device; also, some students who don't take the class serious, and the teacher can't take the problem as the same way as school; those reasons take me to why I think, the best way to learn is going to school, as the classic way; teachers can explain their themes better and answer their students more easy and with better examples at school, also the student can understand the teacher more easy, and it can facilitate their work, also with that way to learn people don't have any problems from old times to now and with that way to teach big entrepreneurs came to the world; the problem of the attendance is not like a big massive problem at school, because the students who want a good education are taking their education more serious and with more effort, and try to don't have any loss class, those students who are worried of their future don't going to lose their opportunity to graduate and have a better future and became a better person with more opportunities, so finally those are the reasons to why I think the best way to learn is going to school and not with distance learning; so those are all my reasons to why I agree and disagree to the idea to have distance learning, and my personal opinion to what can be better for the students learning and my answer to why I think going to school is the better way to learn.",0
"The world has become extremely evolved and is now able to create software that can read every single emotion on a person's face. It can be used in several situations. From the text, the author talked about how it is used to read emotion in paintings and also read emotions of students. This emotion reading technology would be a good addition to the classroom because it could help to make sure kids are more engaged in the lessons.",0
"Today, school can feel long and tiring. If we had emotion reading technology in schools, it would help to engage students more in the lessons. The author explained how if a student begins to show boredom during a lesson, it would be able to change it in a way to please the student. If that was added to schools, students would be able to focus more since the lesson is being tailored to that specific student. Not only will it recognize when a student is bored, but also confused. If a student gets confused during a lesson, the computer can help by repeating that part of the lesson. In a normal classroom with a teacher, you would have to stay after class to be able to get more explanation of the lesson. In paragraph 6, Dr. Huang notes, ""Most human communication is nonverbal, including emotional communication."" What he means by this is that people don't express their emotions by telling them to others. We don't share how we feel. We simply try to express it on our faces. A teacher wouldn't tailor the lesson to each and every person's emotion based on their facial expression. It would be impossible to tailor the lesson to a classroom of 25 students and their needs. Each student in the classroom has a different mind set. Some are able to concentrate well and pass with straight As. Others are unable to concentrate and will only pass with a C. With this new technology, we would be able to tailor the lessons so that each student is able to pass with good grades.",0
"The technology to read facial expressions of emotion would be helpful in the classroom to help students focus more and understand their school work more. If you stop paying attention for just a second, you'll be lost for the majority of the lesson. When there is technology to read your emotions, it'll be able to understand when it needs to modify the lesson to suit the student's needs.",0
"The Face on Mars was not created by aliens, it is only a natural landform on Mars. It is a natural landform on Mars similar to a mesa or butte. The landform only resembles a face and was not made by aliens. Scientists have examined pictures of it and concluded it has no alien decent. The Face is a landform and was not made by aliens.",0
"The first reason the Face is a landform is that the Face is similar to an Earthen landform like a mesa or butte. ""It reminds me most of Middle Butte in the Snake River Plain of Idaho,"" says Gavin. NASA believes this is a rock formation and not anything else. ""That's a lava dome that takes the form of an isolated mesa about the same height as the Face on Mars."" The Mars Face is similar to Earthen landforms, that's why it can't be an alien produced object.",0
"In 1976 the camera photos weren't as good as they are now. The photo in 1976 isn't as reliable as the 2001 photo taken. In paragraph 7 it said, ""revealing a... natural landform."" There was no alien monument after all."" This shows that this newer photo from 1998 shows more evidence than the 1976 photo. More data can be gathered from newer photos to show that the Face is a landform.",0
"If the Face was an alien monument, then NASA would tell people of the information to get an exploration going. They would have sent out another mission to investigate the Face. It said, ""We photographed the Face as soon as we could get a good shot at it."" This shows that NASA was as anxious as the people to try and discover new foreign life. This is why NASA would have investigated if the Face on Mars was an alien monument But it is a landform.",0
"Some people might say that NASA is still lying about the Martian Face being alien related. Conspiracy theorists would say things like the Face is pure evidence of alien life. In paragraph 5 it said, ""the Face is bona fide evidence of life on Mars."" The conspiracy theorists who say this is wrong because NASA has proven that it is a landform. This is why those conspiracy theorists are wrong.",0
"The Face on Mars is a landform. It is not alien related in any way. The scientists at NASA have proven it. NASA would not lie, they need money to fund anything, so they would have to tell people. This is why The Mars Face is not alien related and is a landform.",0
"Society said that the first impression are almost impossible to change. But, I am totally disagreed with that because there are many people in this world that when they go to their first interview they don'tknow how to dress up for an interview, and they may not have someone to show or teach them how to act, how dress up or how important is to be on time when they have interviews or when they're going to meet someone important. It could be a girl or a boy that they're interesting on and their first impression may not be how his/her boss want it to be.",0
"But if they're fascinating on that boy or girl who want the job or went to meet them they may give them a second chance to make their perfect impression and that man/woman that like or want to obtain or to meet they will work really hard to get what they want, they will search or obtain information on how to be presentable or to act in their interviews or when you're meeting someone you are interesting on. For example, If I want a job that is really flexible and easy and that's my first time getting a job, and I am not know nothing about how to be dress up, how to act in front of your future boss or future or girlfriend/boyfriend and how important is to be o time because it's how it works, If you're late to an interview or a place when you will go to meet with that girl/boy they will leave, or they may not interview you. However, If explain to them what happened at the first date or interview that I wasn't presentable or on time they may give me a second chance to do it and that's where I'm going to be at least 10 0r 20 minutes before on that interview or on that date that they gave me and be presentable and known how to act in front of them. They will like it and there you will give them a second impression, and they will give you that job, or you will have the chance to meet more that air/boy that you like awful. In conclusion, there is always a second chance to show or gave people a second impression that they may not believe that you can do it.",0
"Finally, people can not judge people at the first time, they may give them a second chance or explain to them how to do it and that way they can be successful in life, and they can make you happy if you get love each other.",0
"As an eighth-grade student, it is essential to start thinking about my future career options. I believe that the best way to do this is by speaking with teachers in middle school, visiting colleges, and making field trips to relevant companies.",1
"Firstly, speaking with teachers in middle school can provide me with valuable insights into different career paths. Teachers can provide me with information about the skills and knowledge required for each career, as well as the potential benefits and drawbacks of each option. This information can help me make an informed decision about which career to pursue.",1
"Secondly, visiting colleges can give me a better understanding of the education required for my desired career. By visiting different colleges and universities, I can learn about the different programs and courses available, as well as the admission requirements and expectations. This information can help me make an informed decision about which college to attend and which program to pursue.",1
"Finally, making field trips to relevant companies can give me a better understanding of the day-to-day work involved in my desired career. By visiting different companies and speaking with professionals in the field, I can learn about the skills and knowledge required for each job, as well as the potential benefits and drawbacks of each option. This information can help me make an informed decision about which career to pursue.",1
"In addition to researching career options, I also believe that ambition and hard work from a younger age can help me excel in my chosen profession. By setting high goals for myself and working hard to achieve them, I can develop the skills and knowledge required for my desired career. This can include taking challenging courses in high school, participating in extracurricular activities, and seeking out opportunities to gain experience in the field.",1
"Overall, I believe that researching career options by speaking with teachers in middle school, visiting colleges, and making field trips to relevant companies is essential for any eighth-grade student. By taking the time to research and understand the different career paths available, I can make an informed decision about which career to pursue. Additionally, by setting high goals for myself and working hard to achieve them, I can excel in my chosen profession and achieve my full potential.",1
"Dear Principal,",0
"I have noticed you were deciding to make a new policy and were deciding between allowing students to bring phones to school and use them during their own time, or not having students bringing cell-phones at all. As being a student, I think cell-phones are highly important because they are used every day for personal reasons. I strongly believe that you should allow students to bring their phones and only allow them to use their phones during their own time.",0
"From experiences, there are many times when something last minute comes up, and you need to call a parent or guardian to see what is going on. Students with cell-phones can easily call or text their parent or guardian and find out the answer. It is a quick and simple thing to do. But if you do not have cell-phones allowed at school, you would have more students needing to use the office's phone for just the silliest little things. It would cause students to have to constantly use the office phone and would cause you to have another thing to stress about.",0
"Another reason students should have their cell-phones is because there are certain situations when something embarrassing happens, and you would rather talk to your parents in private than having to go to the office. If you talk to your parents on a cell-phone, you can go somewhere private to talk to them. If you go to the office, anybody can go in and hear what you are saying. You can't get complete privacy and even if you talk low enough, the person on the other line might not be able to hear you.",0
"Finally, allowing students to have cell-phones is also a way of trusting us. Taking cell-phones away will cause us to believe you don't trust us. If you have not been hearing complaints from teachers about students cheating with cell-phones, there really isn't any purpose of you having to take them away.",0
"In conclusion, cell-phones are fairly important to the students and should be allowed in school. They are necessary for information on rides and mishaps. We should be trusted with them. If some students don't respect the rules, not everyone should be punished. That is why I think cell-phones should be allowed in school.",0
"""When people ask for advice, they will most likely ask multiple people"". The reason people seek for advice from multiple people is because seeking advice from one person is way too easy and by now some people have figured out that god laughs at us when we try something that's too easy and says, ""Hahaha you really thought you could do that, that's to easy you're going to have to do more if you want to do that!"" I'm getting off-topic. The reason people ask more than one person for advice is because like I said it's too easy so asking more than one person you can have different opinions, but eventually you will get they same answer more often then you have what you should do, just don't ask old people, or they will give you a story, and it will be long and boring. There you go an essay telling you how asking for help from multiple people, can give you multiple opinions and which every one you get more of the same answer and you use that one because it seemed to have worked on other people or there just lying to you and saying ""finally that kids gone"".",0
"But as I was saying, ask multiple people for help, not just one. Asking one is just plain stupid, but asking multiple will give you multiple reasons why you should go with that answer. Think of it like this, if you ask multiple people for help with IDK ask out your crush, most of them tell you to be casual and to not get nervous, so what are you going to choose, the one that you got most of the same answer.",0
"Certainly there are many opinions about the Face found on Mars. Some people believe the Face was made by aliens, while other people believe it is a natural landform. I strongly believe that the Face is a natural landform because there is scientific evidence to prove that a landform could be formed on Mars and there are similar landforms like the Face on Earth.",0
"First, there is scientific evidence that proves landforms can form on Mars.",0
"For example, scientists have found that mountains, canals, and volcanoes have formed on Mars. Scientists have also found that Mars, like Earth, has tectonic plates. Tectonic plates cause many landforms to form when they shift and move around. If tectonic plates create landforms on Earth that no human can, it should be reasonable to think that tectonic plates can be the cause of landforms on Mars.",0
"Secondly, Mars has similar landforms to the landforms on Earth. Just like Earth, Mars has volcanoes, mountains, and canals. Scientist have found that tectonic plates are the cause of many of the landforms we see on Earth today. For example, mountains are formed when two tectonic plates collide and push against each other, trying to push the opposing plate underneath. If none of the plates budge, the plates will begin to push each other up tho form mountains. For canals to form, water would have to run over the land for a while and erode the rocks until a ditch forms. Even though there isn't water on Mars now, scientist have proved that water has once been on Mars. Since water and tectonic plates cause landforms on Earth, the same elements must cause landforms on Mars as well.",0
"Even though I believe that the Face is a natural landform, many other people will disagree with that statement. Many people with opposing viewpoints from mine will say that aliens built the face. Firstly, there is no scientific evidence to even prove the existence of aliens. Secondly, the pictures from the spacecrafts show no sign of any civilization nearby the Face. On Earth, we may have ancient Pyramids that weren't formed naturally, but there were civilizations around those pyramids. Around the Face on Mars there is no sign of any villages or aliens living there. With a Bird-eye view, the face doesn't seem to have any human facial features. Only when there is a shadow, the features of a human being appear. This makes the Face seem like it was just a coincidence that it had terrestrial features. With the lack of evidence to support the claim that aliens made the Face on Mars, it is hard to believe that such an idea could be true.",0
"In conclusion, I believe the Face on Mars is just a natural landform because there are landforms on Earth that are the same as those on Mars and those landforms were made from tectonic plates and water. I believe that you look at the evidence provided to you before you draw any conclusions.",0
"Have you ever had someone to shared wisdom and experience with you before? A friend that has been with you for years. You trust that person, shared your wisdom and experiences with that person.

"Generic_Name likes to help so many people like I do. When somebody drops something, she would pick it up and give it to the person who drops it. She holds doors for teacher, and students even have their hands full of books, or papers. When a friend needs help, she would try to help her friend the best she can because she cares about her friends; want to help them the best can and, she doesn't give so easily.

Phones and Driving,0
"Cell phone use while driving has become the largest cause of automobile crashes over the last two decades. Using a phone while driving can cause distracted driving and even worse car accidents with fatalities. With drivers being distracted, it decreases their awareness on the road and leads to more car crashes. According to the United States Department of Transportation, in 2017, distracted driving claimed 3,166 lives in that year alone. Mobile phone use while driving distracts drivers in two ways; physically and cognitive distraction. Although many laws have been set in place in order for cell phone usage while driving to be banned, many ignore the law and still use cell phones. With this information being concluded, many feels as if drivers should not be able to use cellular phones while driving in any capacity.",0
There are many benefits from decreasing the number of drivers who choose to use their cell phone while driving.,0
"In different states there are different cell phone law variations, but all do the same, they intend to prevent drivers from driving distractedly. Although, these laws are set in place, many do not adhere to and follow these laws. Furthermore, no state has banned the use of cell phones while driving, just adamant enforcement and strict restrictions. For example, fifteen states enforce the handheld cell-phone use law, which prohibits all drivers from using hand-held devices or cell-phones while driving. In addition to laws being put in place, if caught being on a cell-phone while driving, there are fines put in place.",0
"On the other hand, there are many precautions that should be followed to prevent the use of cell phones while driving. Firstly, keeping your cell phone out of arm's length reach it should prevent the use of it. Secondly, if in a situation where a text message must be sent out, do it before driving and let whoever is being texted that you will be unreachable for a certain amount of minutes. Also, silencing a cell phone could be the difference in a life or death situation. Lastly, simply just keeping your focus on the road and not anything else could save a life.",0
"Although cell-phones have detrimental effects on driving, they also have helpful factors as well. Many cell-phones have GPS systems that many people use while driving. Also, ride-share companies use cell-phones as a way to find riders and the drivers even use their cell-phones for GPS reasons. Furthermore, cell phones allow their users to make calls in the case of an emergency. For example, in the case of a serious car accident, where time is of the essence, cell phones are there for paramedics to be contacted immediately. Lastly, being able to use your cell phone while driving, permits you to be able to call authorities if they witness suspicious activity they have seen while driving.",0
"Finally, using your cell-phone while driving has its pros and cons. More importantly, its cons. Cell phone related car accidents and fatalities continue to increase despite the legal legislative action by the states' government that prohibit specific cell phone related activities while driving. Regardless of the educational attempts about the risk of distracted driving and cell phone use to warn the public, many refuse to abide by the law. In conclusion, drivers, in any capacity should not be able to use their cell phones while driving.  ",0
"An old man told me once"" the future does not come to you. You go to the future"". I agree with the principal making every student do one extracurricular activity. The principal making every one do extracurricular activities is a good idea. It's a new way to make friends and have fun, and it can help find what you might want to do in your future.",0
Making everyone do an extracurricular activity is beneficial for the students and the school. These extracurricular activities will help people be able to make new friends because they will share a common interest. When I grew up in Generic_City from first to third grade. I did a lot of extracurricular activities .one of them were soccer. I met a couple of kids that also liked soccer too. So my friends and I would stay after school to play soccer every day.,0
Extra curricular activities would help us find our passion for what we want to do in the future. Extra curricular activities might help student what they want to do in their future at a very young age. People who are in journalism club might want to be a journalist in the future. People who loved since club and all the cool experiments might want to become a scientist when they grew up.,0
"When the old man first told ""future does not come to you. You go to the future."" I was confused. Every second that passes by I go a little into the future, but now I get it. I can't expect my future dream job to just fall into my hands. I need to work to get it. In the end making everyone do extracurricular activities are beneficial. They would help us find what we wanted to do with our future and help us make new friends.",0
"Do you smell that? It's the smell of gasoline and exhaust fumes. Cars are taking over suburban areas. Spewing out solution and contaminating the air. There are solutions, and cities across the world are trying them.",0
"One city that has impacted many is the city of Vauban in Germany, this city has car free streets. They were able to accomplish this by making stores and businesses walking distance. Apparently people are happier without cars, Hadron Walter (citizen of Vauban) while she was walking the streets of Vauban said,"" When I had a car I was always tense. I'm much happier this way."". Furthermore, having car free streets is also beneficial to the fitness of the citizens. Without a car you are forced to walk or ride a bike which is a form of exercise.",0
"Vehicles are terrible for cities. Cars spew exhaust fumes that rise into the air and polite the cities. In Paris, they almost hit record high solution levels. Cars were banned until the solution level went down, smog covered the cities. The solution got trapped in the layers of the smog. The smog levels rivaled Beijing, which is the most polluted city in the world. The only way to cut down on solution is to stop using cars, or switch to hybrids and plug in cars.",0
"Some cities are taking it days at a time. In the city Bogota, Columbia there is a day when no one is allowed to drive. In Bogota they have this one day when no one is allowed to drive, they have this day to cut down solution levels and clear the streets. Other cities have started doing the same thing. This day is very beneficial to the cities It helps decrease solution and smog levels and traffic jams. More people are riding bikes, going to parks and since more people are walking they have made broad, smooth sidewalks.",0
"These movements are changing cities and making them healthier. Soon there will be fewer cars clean air and happier cities. So, are you ready to change.  ",0
"As an 8th grader, I believe that having career guides in high school is incredibly important. Research has shown that students who have access to career guides are more likely to feel excited about coming to school and are more likely to pursue their dream careers. Without career guides, students may struggle to understand their options and may end up in a career that they are not passionate about.",1
"One of the main benefits of having career guides in high school is that they help students understand their options. Career guides provide information on different careers, including job duties, salary ranges, and educational requirements. This information can help students make informed decisions about their future and can help them identify potential career paths that they may not have considered before. Additionally, career guides can help students understand the skills and qualifications needed for different careers, which can help them prepare for their future.",1
"Students without access to career guides may struggle to understand their options and may feel lost when it comes to choosing a career. This can lead to a lack of motivation and engagement in school, as students may feel like they are not being prepared for their future. On the other hand, students who have access to career guides are more likely to feel excited about coming to school and are more likely to be motivated to learn.",1
"To give students the opportunity to pursue the careers they want, schools can provide access to career guides, career counseling, and work-based learning experiences. This can include internships, job shadowing, and other hands-on learning experiences that allow students to gain real-world experience in their chosen career. By providing these opportunities, schools can help students gain the skills and knowledge they need to succeed in their chosen career.",1
"Career guides can also help students feel excited to come to school by providing them with information on potential career paths that they may not have considered before. By exposing students to different careers, career guides can help them find something that they are passionate about and that they want to pursue. This can lead to a more engaged and motivated student body, which can have a positive impact on the entire school.",1
"There are also examples of people who have limited access to career guides. For example, students from low-income families may not have access to the same resources as their peers",1
"Dear Principal,",0
"I think the should let us use our cell phones during lunch or other free times. The reason I think this is that we might or not be able to hang out with your friends, but with our phones we could text them or call them to keep in touch with them.",0
"Another reason why we should have cell phones is, so we can call or text our parents just in case you forgot something and to remind them to pick us up. The last reason why we should be allowed to bring our cell phones is to teach us responsibility.",0
"The first reason why we should be allowed to bring our phones is to stay in touch with our friends when we can't hang out with them. For example, you have no classes with your friend. If you have our cell phones we could stay in touch and not lose our friendship with our friend. Another example is just in case we left something at your friend's house, and we want it back. We would text or call our friend to meet them in a certain location in order to get our stuff back.",0
"The second reason why we should be allowed to use our phones is so could, can tell our parent(s) if they can pick us up or bring us something. For example, I forgot my homework for one of my classes. I would text or call my mom or dad during lunch to tell them to get me my requested item. Another reason is that we could remind them to pick us up. We might have forgotten to tell our mom or dad to pick us after practice or something. Then we would call them to tell them if they could pick us up after school.",0
The final reason is to teach us responsibility. We will be more responsible by turning our phone during classes and to use them only during lunch or other free times. Then we could become more responsible with our phone and maybe with our schoolwork. See having our cell phone could actually teach us something about responsibility.,0
Having our phone could actually teach us something or two about responsibility. We would also be more prepared for class. Another thing is to keep in touch with our loved ones. This is why I strongly agree to be allowed to use our phones.,0
" The way people behave is not always constant, and everyone's personality is not set in stone. People change as they grow and experience different events in their lives. Some people may choose to change their behavior, while others may not. It is important to be aware of the actions we take and the impact they have on our character.",1
"As we grow older, we become more aware of the world around us and our place in it. This awareness can help us make better choices and become stronger people. However, it is also possible to become too aware and let it change us negatively. It is important to find a balance and use our experiences to become better versions of ourselves.",1
"Some people may choose to ignore the world around them and focus only on themselves. While this may be a good thing in some cases, it can also lead to a lack of empathy and understanding for others. It is important to be aware of the impact our actions have on those around us and strive to be a positive influence.",1
"Ultimately, the way we behave and the people we become is a result of our choices and the way we see the world. It is important to be aware of our actions and strive to become the best version of ourselves.",1
"In ""The Challenge of Exploring Venus"", the author writes about a great number of problems that come along with trying to get information on the planetary neighbor, Venus. We, the readers, learn in detail about the specific challenges that come along with studying Venus, even with its proximity to us. Despite the author describing all the struggles that come along with studying our sister planet, the passage still supports the idea that studying Venus is a worthwhile pursuit, through giving us strong examples of useful information we could learn, and describing safer and easier ways that we could study it that would make it far more simple to get the desired data.",0
"While there are certainly many difficulties that the passage describes about getting information from Venus, the author thoroughly explains all the great scientific benefits that we could get out of a Venus mission. As the author describes in paragraph four, ""Astronomers are fascinated by Venus because it may well have once been the most Earth-like planet in our solar system."" Not only will information about Venus teach us more about the surrounding universe, it might just be useful in order to study our own planet. Being able to learn so much from what a previous Earth could have been like would be a massive benefit to fields like history, and the earth sciences. The author goes into even more detail about this just afterward, describing how ""Venus was probably covered largely with oceans and could have supported various forms of life, just like Earth."" Not only are they similar from a geological perspective, it could provide vital information to the studies of biology, and possibly even support details about where we came from to begin with. There are hundreds, if not thousands of scientists specifically studying the cosmos trying to find planets with water that even have a small chance of supporting any form of life. The potential for further discovery here only a short distance away is extraordinary, and the author wisely emphasizes this through the passage.",0
"Not only is the possibility for fascinating exploration and gaining crucial information about the Earth from Venus supported, the author also makes the important point that we are coming closer and closer by the day to this becoming a reality. In the seventh paragraph the author discusses this idea. ""For example, some simplified electronics made of silicon carbide have been tested in a chamber simulating the chaos of Venus's surface and have lasted for three weeks in such conditions."" When they put some of the brightest engineers in the world to a specific task of making electronics that could survive in Venus, the results were successful, as they made them able to survive for almost a month. While a month doesn't sound like a long time for the equipment to last, the author mentions later on in the passage that ""Modern computers are enormously powerful, flexible, and quick, but tend to be more delicate when it comes to extreme physical conditions."" The most delicate part any device that would land on Venus would be the electronics inside any rover or measuring equipment. The great advances in the durability of these electronics points toward an optimistic future in devices designed for Venus, as we are already seeing incredible process being made. However, what would happen if they couldn't find a way around the delicacy of modern computers? The author proves that wouldn't be the end of our Venus hopes, that mechanical computers can be utilized in order to avoid easily broken hardware. Even in the worst case scenario, our scientists are still devising ways to land a probe on Venus.",0
"Though the author presents some great challenges in getting samples and other data from Venus, he strongly supports the idea that studying Venus is a worthy pursuit through the development of new and better ways to survive the harsh atmosphere, and information that could be gained from it that is useful to studying scientific and historical fields back here on Earth that he mentions in the passage. The human race, throughout history, has always remained curious and are willing to sacrifice and go through long periods of experimentation to achieve knowledge. We have faced these struggles as humans before, and this will not be the struggle that stops us. ",0
"Dear Principal, ",1
"I am writing to express my opinion on whether community service should be required for all students. While helping the community is certainly laudable, I do not think mandatory service is the best approach.",1
"There are good intentions behind requiring community service. Helping others is an important value to instill in young people. Through service, students can gain skills and experiences that benefit their personal and academic growth. They may feel more connected to and responsible for the community as a result. ",1
"However, forcing students to serve takes away the intrinsic motivation that comes from volunteering freely. Some may resent being told to give their time, rather than choosing to do so willingly. They may go through the motions without learning deeper life lessons. Requiring service could even have unintended negative impacts, such as students rushing through tasks or not fully engaging in meaningful ways. ",1
"Instead of a mandate, I think a voluntary community service program would be more effective. Students who are interested can sign up to participate in opportunities that suit their schedules and interests. For those who want real-world experience or to strengthen college applications, service can help achieve their goals. But no one should be required to spend non-school hours a certain way if they do not see the value for themselves. ",1
"A well-advertised voluntary program, in which students choose how and where to serve, would foster more positive attitudes. It allows personal growth for those who want to help, without pressuring others. In the long run, more lasting change comes from individuals who care freely, not those who are told they must care. For these reasons, I do not think community service should be mandatory for all students. A voluntary approach is preferable and will still encourage service from those motivated to help their community.",1
"Dear Principal,",0
"My name is STUDENT_NAME, and I am a proud student attending SCHOOL_NAME. I have recently been notified about your plan to possibly require all students to do some sort of community service.",0
"Well, you would be stupid if you didn't require it. As a child that has always been involved with community service I think it is the best way to help others and experience another world.",0
"Students should learn to help others and help the world. This could change a lot of peoples views on life. It could make them realize they can be a good person and help out in a good way to the community. Most kids need something like this to make them feel good about themselves, and they could have fun doing it at the same time!",0
"Maybe you could make it a requirement that you must receive 15 hours or another amount of community service by the end of 8th grade, in order to go to 9th grade. It might just work in our communities favor!",0
"I have many ideas for community service but here are three, and I will start at something pretty simple. A day on Long Beach Island's famous beaches picking up all the garbage. It is outright disgusting to see cigarette buds on the ground.",0
That would help bring people to LBI.,0
The next idea I have for community service is a little more interesting.,0
Holding a buffet for homeless people so that they can enjoy a nice meal for once. Just because they don't have can't afford a home or a car doesn't mean that they can't enjoy a nice meal. They deserve it probably more than you and me.,0
Another community service idea is having a carnival here at the school to raise money for a certain charity or group.,0
"I believe many people would attend, and we could raise a lot of money for someone or a bunch of people. That would really help, quite frankly any amount of community service would help, so I really hope you take my letter into your thoughts and approve of making community service a requirement.",0
"Thank you,",0

Standardized tests have been a part of school life for as long as I can remember. But are they really a good way to measure how smart we are? I don't think so.,1
"First, standardized tests are too narrow. They only test us on a few subjects, like reading, writing, and math. But there are so many other things that we learn in school that are important too, like science, social studies, and art. How can we say that someone is smart if they're only good at a few things?",1
"Another thing is that standardized tests don't take into account that everyone learns differently. Some people are good at taking tests, but that doesn't mean they're the smartest. Maybe they're just good at memorizing stuff, or maybe they have a good teacher who helps them prepare. That's not fair to the people who don't test well, but are still really smart in other ways.",1
"Also, standardized tests are too stressful. We spend weeks and weeks preparing for them, and then we have to sit there for hours and answer questions. It's like, what if I have a bad day? What if I'm feeling sick? That wouldn't be a good measure of how smart I am.",1
"Lastly, I think standardized tests are not really helping us learn. We're so focused on passing the test that we're not really thinking about what we're learning. We're just trying to memorize stuff, so we can do well on the test. That's not real learning.",1
"So, in conclusion, I don't think standardized tests are a good way to measure how smart we are. They're too narrow, they don't take into account how people learn differently, they're too stressful, and they're not really helping us learn. We should find a better way to measure student ability, like projects or presentations, that show what we can really do.",1
" Limiting car usage is an effective way to reduce air pollution. According to the passage set, air pollution poses a significant threat to the health of all citizens. It is responsible for respiratory diseases, such as asthma and bronchitis, and can cause serious health issues in humans. By reducing the number of cars on the road, we can decrease the amount of air pollution and improve the overall health of our citizens.",1
"In addition to improving air quality, limiting car usage can also help to reduce traffic congestion. According to the passage set, traffic congestion is a major problem in many cities and can cause significant delays for drivers. By reducing the number of cars on the road, we can help to reduce traffic congestion and make it easier for people to get where they need to go.",1
"There are also economic benefits to limiting car usage. According to the passage set, the cost of owning and operating a car can be significant, and many families struggle to afford it. By reducing the number of cars on the road, we can help to reduce the cost of transportation for families and make it more affordable for them to get where they need to go.",1
"Finally, limiting car usage can also help to reduce our reliance on foreign oil. According to the passage set, we currently import a large amount of oil from other countries, which can put a strain on our economy and our national security. By reducing the number of cars on the road, we can help to reduce our reliance on foreign oil and make our country more energy independent.",1
"In conclusion, limiting car usage is an effective way to reduce air pollution, reduce traffic congestion, and reduce our reliance on foreign oil. It can also help to reduce the cost of transportation for families. For these reasons, it is important for us to limit our car usage and encourage others to do the same.",1
I think that students should have at least a C average to participate in sports or other activities. Even though students should have a good grade point average they might have trouble with keeping up with balancing their sports time with studying for school.,0
"I personally have a hard time coping with my homework and sports. Practice does take a lot of time and energy, but kids don't always want to stay up all night study for a test or doing homework that isn't important to them. If they don't want to try then they can learn a better way then getting kicked off a team because they don't have a B average.",0
"I think that teachers should limit the homework assignments to a reasonable amount. Students shouldn't have to spend all of their time doing homework and going straight to practice. Maybe if a teacher handed out packets that were always due at the end of the week and were graded for correctness students would try harder and not procrastinate till the last minute because they ""had a busy schedule last night."" Kids might even think that they're too stupid for playing sports because they might not remember plays that easily or know how to do a certain combination. Having a C average isn't that bad if you at least understand the content your supposed to, I have a B average and I still don't understand things perfectly or get good grades on all of my tests.",0
Seventh and eighth grades are very hard to keep up with all the activities and schoolwork. When high school comes around I think that we should have a good idea of our schedules and when we should study or practice for the big game.,0
"Schoolwork is also very important, but kids also need time to themselves.",0
"Schoolwork and other activities are very stressful to balance out, and I don't think that many adults realize that at all. Kids need time to themselves to relax and not be taken over by overwhelming schoolwork and sports.",0
"I disagree with the principal's decision to mandate that all students participate in at least one extracurricular activity. While extracurricular activities offer many benefits, students should have the freedom to choose how they spend their time outside the classroom.",1
"Requiring participation in extracurriculars fails to consider important individual circumstances. Some students may need to prioritize employment, family responsibilities, or studying to maintain strong grades. Extracurricular activities demand a significant time commitment, from practices to events. This obligation could create undue stress on students juggling heavy course loads or other commitments. Additionally, not all activities suit every student. Forcing participation means students may be involved in programs that do not interest them. This less engagement and effort which undermines the goals of extracurriculars. ",1
"Rather than mandating involvement, the school would be better off encouraging participation and facilitating opportunities for students. Promoting the beneficial impact of extracurriculars on skills like teamwork, leadership and time management may inspire more voluntary involvement. Offering a diverse selection of activities at different time slots, alongside academic support for struggling students, allows all to find options compatible with their needs and schedules. Those who do participate will likely gain more from being genuinely invested in their choice of activity. ",1
"In conclusion, while instilling the importance of enriching education outside the classroom is admirable, requiring participation violates student independence and fail to accommodate individual circumstances. Extracurricular activities are most impactful when students personally elect to be involved. The school should focus on cultivating opportunities and interest to inspire voluntary participation rather than mandating obligations.",1

"Dear Senator,",1
I am writing to you today to urge you to support abolishing the Electoral College and electing the President of the United States by popular vote. The Electoral College is an outdated institution that is no longer relevant in our modern society. It is time for us to move on from this undemocratic system and choose our President based on the will of the people.,1
"There are many reasons why the Electoral College should be abolished. First, it is unfair. Under the Electoral College system, a candidate can win the popular vote but still lose the election. This happened in 2000, when Al Gore won the popular vote but lost to George W. Bush. It also happened in 2016, when Hillary Clinton won the popular vote but lost to Donald Trump. This is simply not fair to the millions of Americans who voted for the losing candidate.",1
"Second, the Electoral College gives too much power to a few states. The current system is based on the number of electoral votes each state has, which is determined by its population. This means that states with large populations have more electoral votes than states with small populations. This gives these large states an unfair advantage in the Electoral College.",1
"Third, the Electoral College discourages voter participation. Many people in states that are considered to be ""safe"" for one party or the other feel that their vote doesn't matter. This is because the Electoral College system is winner-take-all in most states. This means that if one candidate wins a majority of the votes in a state, they get all of that state's electoral votes. This discourages people from voting because they feel like their vote won't make a difference.",1
"Fourth, the Electoral College is not democratic. The very idea of having a group of electors chooses the President instead of the people themselves is undemocratic. This system is based on the idea that the people are not qualified to choose their own President. This is simply not true. The people are perfectly capable of choosing their own President, and they should be allowed to do so.",1
"In conclusion, there are many reasons why the Electoral College should be abolished. It is unfair, it gives too much power to a few states, it discourages voter participation, and it is not democratic. I urge you to support abolishing the Electoral College and electing the President of the United States by popular vote.",1

"I believe that students would benefit from distance learning. Some students need more well focused attention and help than others. From my public school experience so far, I have witnessed kids not learning everything they need to know including myself. I believe that this happens in public schools because the teacher has two- hundred other kids to focus on as well. Online school at home could be very beneficial for students to take more opportunities and time they need to learn and understand a subject.",0
"Video conferencing is a great idea because, not only is the student being well focused on but he/she has more time to ask questions without being laughed at. Bullying is a lot more personal and harsh these days. Students that have no motivation to get out of bed and go to school because of bullying will especially benefit from distance learning. Bullying seriously leads to students not attending school and skipping. Online school is an opportunity to prevent these issues.",0
"Distance learning is a great idea and I think that all schools should provide this opportunity. Not only would more kids graduate, more students would have a better life in the end. Collage is a very important opportunity that every kid should be in the grasps of. Even if that means attending classes from home. I don't see why any parent or school should be against this academic opportunity.",0
From my point of view I have the opportunity to attend my classes from home. Myself personally I enjoy public learning and socialization. It's nice to know if I ever have any problems in public school I can transfer to distance learning. If anything it's more beneficial than it is harmful.,0
"I don't expect everyone to agree with this particular opportunity but, it's a topic every parent should take under advisement. Especially if their child ID struggling in any way. For example physical abuse from other students does happen in public schools. Mental abuse also occurs as well. Public schools can be very challenging and hard for some students. Attending classes online from home is a great way to avoid physical and mental abuse if it is occurring.",0
"As a student myself speaking, I hope that all guardians never shut down the idea of distance learning. I believe that any child can and will benefit from this opportunity. Some public schools are just too challenging for some kids and can be very difficult to get through. Now after stating all my points and opinions on distance learning, I hope that the idea stays open to all students and families that ever need it. ",0
"Today's society uses automotive vehicles almost every day. When they go to work, to go to school, to go shopping, for fun, or anywhere they want to go. Smog has been building up from the cars' pollution for a very long time. Using Vehicles less will decrease smog, improve people's health, a will be better for the earth. Using automotive transportation less will help everyone an in the whole world from humans to the air we breathe, from animals to the grass they eat.",0
"However, using vehicles less will decrease the smog amount all around the world. Smog affects everything so decreasing it will help everyone an out greatly. Banning cars for a day or banning odd-numbered plates for just one day would help out tremendously. In France, they have banned odd-numbered an even-numbered plate numbers for one day each on different days. "" The smog cleared enough Monday for the ruling French party to resting the ban for odd-numbered plate on Tuesday."" So even banning vehicles one day can have a huge impact on decreasing smog. And it also clears up congestion on the roads.",0
"However, by using automotive transportation less it will improve people's health. Walking, skateboarding, riding bicycles, or running will all improve your health. If you had to go somewhere you could walk there and it would improve your cardio. If you do this in a large city for one day a great majority of people would participate. ""In Colombia, a program took place an million of Colombians hiked, biked, skated or took buses to work."" That would greatly take an impact on the smog ratio. And all of those millions of people who participated got plenty of excessive for the day to improve their health.",0
"So, by using automotive vehicles less it would tremendously help the entire Earth. Smog affects pretty much everything. The air that all the humans and animals breath in is polluted. The air is polluted, so it affects the grass an vegetable that animals an human consume for energy. It affects the trees that give off fresh oxygen, so we can continue to breath. ""It's a good opportunity to take away stress and lower air pollution."" Not driving would take away traffic jams therefore, people would not stress as much and also traffic jams cause a gigantic amount of air pollution so not driving would greatly help the entire Earth that we live on.",0
"In conclusion, using automotive transportation less would greatly help reduce smog build up, improve everyone's health, and it would tremendously help the Earth. It would lower air pollution so that the air we breathe in would not be harmful to us. Even if we just banned cars for one day the whole Earth would be a lot cleaner. In the U.S. the numbers of miles driving peaked in 2005 and have dropped steadily since then. People are starting to drive less and less and it is greatly helping the entire world.  ",0
"I believe that summer projects should be student-designed. I believe that because students should be able to have fun over their break and not have to worry about what the teacher picked for them to do. Also, I believe this because sometimes teachers don't know what the students like to do or not. Lastly, what if the students went somewhere else for the break and didn't have any time in to doing it?.",0
I believe that students should be able to have fun and not to have to worry about what the teacher assigned them to do. I know since I'm a student myself that i wouldn't want to do a project that my teacher picked for me to do. Students should be able to pick the project them self and have fun with it.,0
"Also, I believe this because sometimes teachers don't know what the students like to do or not. The teachers don't really get into the social life of the students, so It's hard to say what they really like to do. I know that the teachers try to do what's best for you and that they try to help out when they can, but sometimes they just don't know what is actually best for you, so they should be able to let you pick your project.",0
"Lastly, what if the students went somewhere else for the break and didn't have time to do what the teachers asked them to do?. If the student went out of town and didn't have any of the thing that the project needs, then they're going to get a zero on it even tho they are not home all summer break. However, if the student was to pick their own project, then they would've gotten it done with the things they had on their trip.",0
"Students should be able to pick their own summer project. They should be able to pick it because students should be having fun over break. They should also pick their project because sometimes teachers don't know what the students like to do. Also, students could go out of town during the summer and not have any of the thing the teacher wants them to do the project with. These are all the reasons why I believe that students should be able to pick their own project.  ",0
"I believe everyone should become a Seagoing Cowboy because of how much help you can bring other people. For example, it was right when World War II ended that the UNRWA hired Seagoing Cowboys to recover animals for the countries that were left in ruins. I did this job of recovering cattle even when it was hard. I was helping not only for Seagoing Cowboys it was also my military service.",0
Another reason for joining the Seagoing Cowboys is it opens up the world. When you are delivering animals to other countries there are so many things to see. You get to see marvelous places. For example when I was taking cattle to Greece I got to see most of Europe and China.,0
"There are so many beneficial reasons for becoming a Seagoing Cowboy. You are helping others in need and having fun at the same time;once you have fulfilled your duties, that pleasure of helping out will stay with you forever. For example, in the current day my family and I have exchange students. I loved being a Seagoing Cowboy and I hope this inspires you to become a Seagoing Cowboy too.  ",0
"Twenty-five years ago the Viking 1 spacecraft was taking pictures of Mars, when the spacecraft got a picture of something that looked like a human face, they named it the Face. Scientist from NASA have done father research on the Face and think that it is a mesa, but others think that the Face was created by aliens. The Face on Mars is simply, a natural landform, and was not created by aliens like some people think.",0
"When the scientist discovered the Face they were very excited because they thought it was something special, but the feeling was short-lived. The scientist figured out it was a Martian mesa, which is very common around Colonia. To better describe the Face would be to say it is: a huge rock formation that resembles a human head. A mesa is a rock formation and rocks can look like all kinds of things, even a human head.",0
"Pictures were taken of the Face in 1976, 1998, and 2001 the resolution on the pictures getting better as technology advances. If one simply looks at the pictures they could tell that the Face is just a rock, and it was not alien-made. In 1998 the Mars Global Surveyor flew over Colonia for the first time and took pictures that were ten times sharper than the original pictures, it was then that the scientist decided that the Face was a rock. The people were still in denial, so NASA set out to get more pictures in 2001. When the pictures came back it was clear that the Face was still just a mesa and was not made by aliens.",0
"At this point the scientist were satisfied, the Face was just a Martian equivalent to a butte or mesa. One scientist even compared it to things on Earth. Scientist Jim Gavin said, ""It reminds me most of Middle Butte in the Snake River Plain of Idaho"". The Face is a mesa that was formed naturally just like a mesa on Earth. They both look the same and were not created by aliens.",0
"The Face that was found on Mars in 1976, was not made by plans and is just a mesa that was formed naturally. Multiple pictures determined that it just happened to look like a human face and upon closer examination was not alien-made. The Face has been compared to things on Earth like a butte or a mesa multiple times. This proves that the Face was not made by aliens and is a natural Martian mesa.",0
"The idea of limiting the duration of those in power to five years is an interesting one. It is an attempt to ensure that power does not corrupt people excessively. There are pros and cons to this idea, and in this essay, I will discuss both sides of the argument.",1
"On the one hand, some people believe that limiting the duration of those in power to five years is a good idea. One reason for this is that it prevents people from becoming too comfortable in their positions. When people stay in power for too long, they become complacent and lose touch with the needs and desires of the people they are supposed to serve. By limiting their time in power, we can ensure that they remain motivated and responsive to the needs of the people.",1
"Another reason why some people support this idea is that it prevents the accumulation of power by a small group of people. When people stay in power for too long, they tend to develop networks and alliances that make it difficult for others to challenge them. By limiting their time in power, we can ensure that new ideas and perspectives are brought to the table regularly. This will lead to more innovation and progress.",1
"On the other hand, there are also arguments against this idea. One of the main arguments against it is that it takes time for people to learn their jobs properly. If people are constantly stepping down after five years, then there will be a constant turnover of people in positions of power. This could lead to a lack of continuity and stability in government, education, business, and so on.",1
"Another argument against this idea is that it can lead to a lack of accountability. When people know that they only have five years in power, they may be tempted to take risks and make decisions that are designed to benefit them personally rather than the people they are supposed to serve. There is also the risk that people will simply be more concerned with their legacy rather than making decisions that are truly in the best interest of the people.",1
"In conclusion, there are pros and cons to limiting the duration of those in power to five years. On the one hand, it can prevent people from becoming too comfortable in their positions and prevent the accumulation of power by a small group of people. On the other hand, it can lead to a lack of continuity and accountability. Ultimately, it is up to each individual society to decide whether this idea is worth implementing. What is important is that we continue to have discussions about how to ensure that those in power are held accountable and that they are responsive to the needs of the people they are supposed to serve.",1
"The use of technology such as, Facial Action Coding system, is totally necessary in the classroom setting. Claiming that"" 'A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored.' "" Is an ineffective way to really, truly get through to the students. Instead of focusing on adding more technology to the classroom, maybe giving teachers a better salary and better education would help the teachers teach better, then the students would understand the material better. In the article, it says"" we humans perform the same impressive 'calculation' every day"". If humans already have this natural ability, then adding more technology into the classroom that teacher could already be doing, is necessary and distracting. I am sure there are some upsides to this, but it really just feels like an invasion of the students' privacy. In the article is says"" ' Then it could modify the lesson, like an effective human instructor'"" ",0
"The teacher can not just modify an entire lesson because one student is confused, that is unfair to the students that understand the lesson already. Instead, the teacher could work with the student individually and help them with what they are having trouble with. All in all, adding more necessary technology into the classroom would be distracting to the students and an invasion of their privacy. The ""Facial Action Coding system"" could be useful somewhere else, just not the classroom.",0
"The use of Facial Action Coding Systems in classrooms raises important privacy concerns that outweigh its potential benefits. While identifying students' emotional states could provide teachers insights, closely monitoring expressions risks invading students' privacy and altering natural classroom dynamics. ",1
"This technology allows computers to catalog the subtle muscular movements that comprise human facial expressions. Proponents argue it could help teachers understand how their lessons are affecting students and adjust accordingly. Identifying boredom or confusion could help improve instruction. However, emotions are complex and personal, and constant monitoring may compromise students' sense of autonomy and security. Natural expression of feelings is important for learning and development. ",1
"Requiring students to perform for cameras analyzing their every reaction could create unwelcome pressure. Knowing they are being watched so intimately may make some students anxious or less willing to take academic risks. Students' emotions should not be treated as data to optimize, but understood in context of their individual experiences. Teachers valuing close relationships with students can identify issues without invasive technology. ",1
"There are also risks in over-reliance on facial expressions alone to assess learning. Students learn and process information in diverse ways, and emotions may not reliably indicate comprehension. Cultural and social differences further complicate expression analysis. Administrators must consider whether benefits outweigh potential harms to students' privacy and well-being. If utilized, strong safeguards and parental consent would be needed. Overall the drawbacks likely outweigh advantages, and teachers are best equipped to evaluate students through more human-centered means.",1
I think you boys should join the seagoing cowboys. Do you now why I want you to join It's because you will have the time of your life? Then you also get to be on a bout when the waves hit the bout sometimes it fells like your riding your house. I'm going to tell you about what it is like being a sea cowboy and the appearances.,0
When you are on the bout you get to feed and be around the cattle all you want. Then when we guy have time to real reacts we have like table tennis tournaments and read you now stuff like that. Then You also have real good times on the bout being a sea cowboy I would say.,0
When you are of the bout sometimes you get to see what's in town like once I went to Venice Italy a city with streets of water. I also get to tour an excavated castle in Crete and marveled the Panama Canal on my way to Chine boy was it cool.,0
"Final when we drop of the cattle and stuff we have tuns of free time when we are at sea. Once we had a fencing tournaments. When we were done with that we also got to play baseball and volleyball in the empty holds where the animals where, and we did more stuff like boxing and reading whittling and games to.",0
Final do you see how being a cowboy on the sea can be exciting. These are just some reasons why you should become a seagoing cowboy. Then now that you boys herd me I will be on my just think about signing up ok. Then see you boys on the docks hopefully.  ,0
"Yes, I do think it's a good idea for computers to read students emotions. I think it's a good idea because some students might have suicidal thoughts or might be suffering from abuse. It's always good to know what students are going through when they are sad. A lot of students doesn't like to show emotions or tell anyone about it. This Facial Action Coding system can prevent suicide.",0
"Everyone will not think this program is safe, and is invading privacy.",0
"But, this system can save suicidal people from all over the world. Prof. Thomas, Prof. NICU, and Prof. Huang and his colleague are experts at developing better ways for humans and computers to communicate. Emotions can be solved like math equations with this program.",0
This program should be put in all computers over the world to help you with school work also. This new technology can also help you with your work like a teacher. If the computer reads that you are stressed then it could explain the question to you better or help you. This new technology program can change the world.,0
I believe that this program will spread on others and used by millions if this new technology is approved. This can be big help with teachers also. It could help them receive stress and give them advice or take a day off because of stress levels. It could improve humans and make them stress-free.,0
"My inclusion is that this program can help everyone with their problems and stressful moments. I think it's a good idea to read emotions and can prevent suicide. There is not a doubt in my mind that will make me change my final answer. Your face doesn't lie, and this program will be able to tell it like a polygraph. ",0
"A world without an ozone. People walking place to place. No electricity. There is no fossil fuel. These are some potential, yet dramatic, long run effects of the growing car usage since the early 1950s. Limiting this could cause a better environment, more nonrenewable energy, and safer environments.",0
"This new idea of limited car usage could improve our environment. The ozone layer is being depleted and many believe it is due to the fossil fuels being burned by cars, trains, planes, and many other types of things. If everyone did not use their car for just a few days a month, then imagine how great the atmosphere would turn out. Some people such as Hadron Walter, a new member of a ""carless"" community says that, he is much happier this way.",0
"As many of you may know, the nonrenewable energy source, also known as fossil fuels, is slowly but surely running out. Like stated before, if we were to just not use vehicles a few days out of every month, then these resources may slowly start to build back up. We definitely would not be using as much. There is a town in Germany that does not allow car parking on the street and the usage of a vehicle is very limited. It is said that there is only the occasional distant motor sound. Imagine how much money they spend on gas. That was sarcasm.",0
"Finally, we all know how worried everyone is about getting in a car accident, or being hit by a car, or getting 'T-boned."" Imagine being able to walk knowing in peace that there would be no accidents. Children would be able to roam the streets. The town wouldn't be as spaced out because things have to be within walking distance. IT would all be a part of something called ""smart planning.""",0
"It would be wonderful not having to worry about danger or ozone being depleted. Knowing that an energy source would always be around would be nice too. Everyone could agree that this is a glorious idea and the turn of a new leaf, the start of a new world. A more safe and stable world. So keep them in the garage and grab that bike you bought three years ago. Start peddling.  ",0
"When asking for advice it is better to ask multiple people rather than one person. Asking more than person can help you because not all people have the same mind set. Sometimes if you only ask one person for advice they can give you something they think is right in that situation, but it can turn out not the right advice that you needed. But if you ask multiple people like three or four and see what the common opinion is you can take the right advice. And people tend to ask more than one people because they don't want to be provided the wrong advice. And if you are provided the wrong advice you cloud lose trust.",0
"It is better to ask more than one person for many reasons for example if you ask one of your friends if what you should wear to a party, and they give you what they think. And then you go and see everybody there is wearing a different style than yours. But that could have been avoided if you had asked the advice of four friends, and then they could have given you the style that they thought was worn. Another example is if you ask one of your friends what you should get as a snack, and they give you a bag of chips and later on you don't like the chips. But if you had asked multiple friends what a good snack was they would have probably recommended a better snack than the chips. Or if you ask is you think you should ask somebody out, and they say yeah or if you ask some more friends and they don't think it's that great in idea to ask that person out.",0
"The advice from a group would most likely be better than by asking one of your friends. Because if you ask one person what's in style. Then can give you some advice, and then you take their advice, and you wear it and people don't like it. Or if you need advice on what you should do in a situation, and you ask one of your close friends what they thin you should do, and they give you the wrong advice you cloud wind up doing the wrong thing in that situation. And sometimes they can lead you into the wrong things would get you in trouble. Or you cloud be put in a situation that you don't know what is right, and you take the wrong advice could have a bad reputation, or it could lead to you losing people you were close to. And you cloud hurt somebody if you do take the wrong advice which could lead to getting shamed.",0
"And that is why asking more than one person is better than asking one person and that person only. Because no matter who you ask you're probably going to get multiple answers, but you can compare and see who has common advice. You want to ask the group so you don't get embarrassed in front of people or eat something that you don't like that isn't very popular among people. Or something you don't enjoy doing that person thinks is fun, but it is a popular opinion to people. But if you ask a handful of close friends or even just people you can see the common advice people will give of what they think they would do in your situation, and you can see that more people think something else is right rather than the one or two people who thin something else is right.",0
"State Senator,",0
"I strongly believe in canceling the Electoral College. Not only does this process make us believe we are voting for the president when in reality we are just sending our votes to a bunch of electors, but it also isn't entirely trustworthy. Sometimes a voter can get confused about the elector and vote for the wrong candidate. If there happens to be a tie in the votes, the election is moved to the House of Representatives. The tie could mean that the House's selection wouldn't meet the standards to make the people happy. The Electoral College system is really unfair to its voters. This system called the winner take all system makes candidates move away from states they have no chance of winning.",0
"The Electoral College is not fair to its voters, out of date, and irrational. Peoples arguments about it are mostly just assertions without reality on their side. I mean, why have we not changed this system yet? The votes get sent to electors, not the president. We've been using this system for a long time, it's not accurate, trustworthy, or modern. America is all about change. How are we going to change if we hold on to the same voting system? We don't.",0
"In Hawaii 1960, two slates of electors were sent to congress. Richard Nixon luckily validated the opposing sides electors. If this happens again it can end badly. In the same year, segregationists almost succeeded in replacing the Democratic electors with brand-new ones that were against John F. Kennedy. With this, a popular vote towards Kennedy would never have gotten to him. Also, faithless electors usually refuse to vote for their candidate and vote for whoever.",0
"If possible, get rid of this system. History has proven that The Electoral College has to many flaws. It needs to be taken care of.",0

The Park: A Treasure Trove of Opportunities and Fun,1
"As an avid park enthusiast, I have always been amazed by the vast array of opportunities that the park provides. From a serene place for relaxation to a hub for physical activity, the park is truly a treasure trove of possibilities. However, despite its numerous benefits, the park is not visited as much as it used to be. In this essay, I will explore the reasons behind this decline and discuss the importance of the park in our lives. Additionally, I will provide some ideas for fun and entertaining activities that people can do at the park.",1
"One of the primary reasons why the park is not visited as much as before is the rise of technology. With the advent of smartphones, video games, and social media, people are increasingly opting to spend their free time indoors, glued to their screens. This shift in behavior has led to a decline in park attendance, as people no longer see the park as a viable option for leisure activities.",1
"However, it is important to recognize the value of the park in our lives. The park provides a much-needed break from the hustle and bustle of daily life. It is a place where people can escape the stresses of work and school and reconnect with nature. Furthermore, the park is a valuable resource for physical activity. From playing sports to going for a walk or bike ride, the park provides ample opportunities for exercise and outdoor recreation.",1
"In addition to its physical benefits, the park also offers a variety of mental health benefits. Spending time in nature has been shown to reduce stress, improve mood, and boost overall well-being. Furthermore, the park is a great place for socializing and building community. From having a picnic with friends to attending a concert or festival, the park provides a variety of opportunities for social interaction.",1
"So, how can we encourage people to visit the park more often? One solution is to promote the park as a fun and entertaining destination. There are countless activities that people can do at the park, from playing Frisbee to having a barbecue. Additionally, the park can be transformed into a hub for creative activities, such as painting, sculpting, or photography. By highlighting the many opportunities that the park provides, we can help to rekindle people's interest in this valuable resource.",1
"This article tells us the technology of facial and emotion recognitions. Every day, we may walk around with expressions on our faces that shows how we feel or what you want to show others what you're feeling. Other times we put on a happy face but on the inside we're actually pretty sad. Dr. Paul is the creator for FACS (Facial Action Coding System). I am for this new way of knowing someone's emotions just looking at a picture and especially through paintings.",0
"Dr. Paul is the creator of FACS. He was able to identify variety of emotions in one picture or painting. Beckman have found the basic emotions such as happy, surprise, anger, disgusted, fear, and sadness. They were also able to identify mixed feelings. Some examples of knowing what one person might be thinking. When a person raises their eyebrows they are showing that they are surprise. When a person shows that they are angry their eyebrows point inward and eyes are focused intently at someone else. When we are with our friends we are able to know what they are thinking or feeling most of the time. We know when they are happy, sad, or even excited, this technology allows us to look into it deeper. Unlike our PC computers at home, it doesn't have that advance technology that can read our expressions. In the article is saying that they would write dome simple codings to different emotions. In an environment like school it would be interesting to use this type of technology among the students. FACS would help the teachers to identify which students are paying attention and who are bored just using this.",0
"In the painting of Mona Lisa they were able to figure that there was 83 percent happy, 9 percent disguised, 6 fearful, and 2 percent anger. This technology can be helpful in many ways. It calculates emotions through movements in a picture and varies in different emotions, and are able to calculate mixed feelings. Some students go through some hard times and others may not see the things they are going through just looking at their faces. Some students are able to show the opposite emotion of what they are feeling to guard themselves and not be seen as vulnerable.  ",0
"I disagree with the idea that the government should not put money towards building theaters and sports stadiums. Instead, I believe that the government should focus on investing in medical care and education.",1
"There are a few reasons why I believe this. First, medical care and education are essential for the well-being of a population. They provide the basic building blocks for a strong society. Second, medical care and education are not as expensive as theaters and sports stadiums. The government can get more bang for it's buck by investing in these areas. Finally, medical care and education are important for the future of a country. They provide opportunities for people to improve their lives and contribute to society.",1
"In contrast, theaters and sports stadiums are not as important. They are a luxury, not a necessity. They do not have the same impact on society as medical care and education.",1
"For these reasons, I believe that the government should focus on investing in medical care and education, not theaters and sports stadiums.",1
"My fellow citizens, some advantages of limiting car usage is that it's better for the earth and reduces the greenhouse effect.",0
"Also, there won't be as much smog and there will be a lot less pollution in the air.  Limiting the usage of cars can be a better for you. Not using a car can really benefit us.",0
People use cars every day for everyday things.  If people cut down on the usage of cars and took the bus or even rode a bike to work it really could help the earth.  Fewer cars mean less of the greenhouse effect.  Less of the greenhouse effect means a better world.,0
"Billions of people driving cars can really pollute the earth.  Paris had to ban driving because the smog was too great and needed to be cleared from the sky.  The smog was so serious that if you didn't leave your car at home you would get a fine.  Almost 4,000 people were fined.  Beijing, China is one of the most polluted city in the world because of smog.",0
"If you don't take a car you could walk, bike, or skate witch could be fun.  If not then you could always take the bus and still help of the earth.  If you didn't take a car to work then it could reduce traffic.  Some people enjoy riding a bike instead of a car because it reduces stress and also reduces pollution to the earth.",0
Limiting car use is not only good for you but also good for the earth its self.  There could be less greenhouse effect and smog.  Let's all help and limit the usage of cars.,0
"There is no right or wrong answer to this question - it is entirely up to the individual's personal opinion. However, I do believe that education is a life-long process, and here are three reasons why:",1
1. Learning is a lifelong journey,1
"As humans, we are constantly learning new things - whether it be about the world around us, new facts and figures, or how to do new things. This is because learning is a fundamental part of who we are, and it is something that we continue to do throughout our lives.",1
2. The world is constantly changing,1
"The world is constantly changing, and with it comes new challenges and opportunities. As educators, it is our job to ensure that our students are equipped with the skills and knowledge they need to thrive in a constantly-evolving world. This means that learning must also be a lifelong process, in order to keep up with the latest trends and developments.",1
3. Life is unpredictable,1
"Life is unpredictable, which means that we never know what opportunities or challenges might come our way. It is therefore important to be constantly learning and upgrading our skills, in order to be prepared for anything that comes our way.",1
"In conclusion, I believe that education is a life-long process, and there are plenty of reasons why this is the case. It is important for us to constantly be learning and upgrading our skills, in order to be prepared for the unpredictable world we live in.",1
"Dear me. Senator, Today I am asking for your favor of keeping the Electoral College or changing to election by popular vote for the President of the United States. This process now consists of the selection of the electors and meeting where they vote for the president and vice president, and the counting of votes by the congress. The Electoral College consists of 538 electors, but only 270 of those votes are required to elect the president. I think that we should change the way that our citizens vote. I also think that we should update how the elections are run.",0
"First, we should change the way that our citizens vote. When we vote for a president we are actually just voting for that Elector. So there is a possibility that the Elector could vote for the opposite president and your vote basically not be put in. I think that our citizens should have enough rights that they don't have to have Elector to do the voting for them, and we can all just vote for whom we want. For instance, it could be just all politics and the Electors get paid to vote for a certain person and that's why most of the presidents who get elected today.",0
"Secondly, We should update how the voting system works. Instead of it being 270 people out of 538, we should just have everyone one vote without Electors. Then everyone would have there say in the voting system, and then they could just average it out or figure out the math of who won by percentage. For instance, take the number of all the people who voted for both presidents and take the number of one of the presidents and divide them by each other, and multiply it times 100. Then all the political stuff wouldn't happen because everyone's vote counted. Maybe a change in the system would be a good idea.",0
"Last but not least, In The Indefensible Electoral College: Why even the best laid defenses of the system are wrong, Bradford said that in 1960 segregationists in the Louisiana legislature nearly succeeded in replacing the Democratic electors with new electors who would oppose John F. Kennedy. So that vote would not have actually gone to Kennedy. So the Electors are not as reliable as everyone thought. Some Electors have also refused to vote for there parties candidate. My honest opinion is to just change the Electoral College.",0
"In conclusion, I am writing to you me. Senator in hopes that you can fix the Electoral College and change the election to a popular vote. If this were to happen, it could make our citizens have a little more rights. We may also update our system a little so that the election voting is a little more accurate so that everyone gets to get there vote in. Maybe this could be what solves most of the political problems in the world.",0
"Dear Principal,",1
"The issue of whether students should be required to perform community service is a contentious one, and I understand that there are valid arguments on both sides. However, based on my own experiences and observations, I believe that community service should be a requirement for all students.",1
"One of the primary reasons for this is that community service provides students with opportunities to develop important life skills such as leadership, teamwork, responsibility, and empathy. For example, when I participated in a local food drive last year, I was able to work with a diverse group of people towards a common goal, and I learned how to effectively communicate and delegate tasks in order to ensure the success of the project. These skills will not only serve me well in my future academic and professional pursuits, but also in my personal life as a responsible and engaged citizen.",1
"Furthermore, community service allows students to make meaningful contributions to their communities, which can have a positive impact on their own self-confidence and sense of purpose. For instance, when I volunteered at a local homeless shelter, I was able to witness firsthand the impact that even small acts of kindness and generosity can have on improving the lives of others. This experience not only gave me a sense of fulfillment and purpose, but also helped me to develop a greater appreciation for the privileges that I have in my life.",1
"While I understand the objections that some students may have about the time commitment required for community service, I believe that the benefits of such activities far outweigh any inconvenience or sacrifice that may be required. Ultimately, community service is an integral part of our education as students, and I hope that you will consider making it a requirement for all future students.",1
Thank you for your consideration.,1
"Sincerely,",1

I am writing to you today to express my support for abolishing the Electoral College and electing the President of the United States by popular vote.,1
"The Electoral College is an outdated system that no longer reflects the will of the American people. In the past, the Electoral College was necessary to ensure that smaller states had a voice in the presidential election. However, in today's society, where nearly every citizen has access to the same information and resources, there is no need for the Electoral College to give smaller states an unfair advantage.",1
"In fact, the Electoral College actually disenfranchises millions of Americans. In the last two elections, the popular vote winner has lost the Electoral College vote. This means that millions of Americans' votes have been effectively nullified.",1
"There are several reasons why the Electoral College is unfair. First, it gives more power to voters in less populated states. For example, a voter in Wyoming has nearly six times the power of a voter in California. This is because Wyoming has three electoral votes and California has 55 electoral votes.",1
"Second, the Electoral College encourages candidates to focus their campaigns on a few ""swing states."" This is because a candidate can win the presidency by winning just a few key states, even if they lose the popular vote.",1
"Third, the Electoral College is susceptible to fraud and abuse. In the 2000 election, for example, the outcome of the election was decided by a Supreme Court decision that many people believe was wrong.",1
"For these reasons, I urge you to support abolishing the Electoral College. The Electoral College is an outdated and unfair system that no longer serves the interests of the American people.",1
Thank you for your time and consideration.,1

Because I think we all fake our smiles sometimes, let's say that I don't feel good, or I am angry, but I don't anyone or anybody to know how I feel because I am pretty sure not every one of us is always ready to let people know how they are feeling, we fake our smile and still smile, but we don't really mean it, we smile outside, but we feel like crying inside, and most of the time if you come out and say how you are feeling no one will notice it except if you told them yourself, so what I am trying to say is that a computer cannot tell whether a person is happy, sad, fear, angry. And in the second paragraph it says that we or computer can ""calculate"" our emotions and I still don't believe that can ever happen because we express how we feel we can't count our emotions.",0

"Although not having driveless cars seems more safe, I'm for driveless cars. I'm for driveless cars because it could be making driving more fun. Driverless cars sounds dangerous but it's really safer than regular cars. The driveless car has many more good advantages than a regular car.",0
"I'm for driveless cars because it has good advantages such as there a senor that are advanced to detect and respond to the danger of out-of-control skids or roll-overs. Regular cars do have some good advantages too but driveless cars has been driven more than half a million miles without being crashed. Even though driveless cars uses half of the fuel of today's taxis, it's making driving fun in a new way.",0
Driverless cars may not sound safe but really it's safer than regular cars. Regular cars don't have senors to tell when danger is near and regular cars are boring. This idea would bring people out more and experience the world with a nice car. Driverless cars could be the best invention ever!,0
Phone Usage While Driving,0
"Should drivers be able to use cell phone while operating a vehicle? No, no driver should be able to use a cell phone while operating a vehicle. The usage of cell phone while driving has been a big issue over the years. Driving is a big responsibility.",0
"Over the years, the number of death have increased because of all the unnecessary car accidents caused by those who are driving and being on the phone. There have been many accidents some injured and some killed. People should understand that driving is a big responsibility. While operating a vehicle you need to think about those around you. Let's say, you are operating a vehicle and you on your phone texting, and you get into a car accident. Now they have to call your close ones and tell them the tragedy news. You will put your loved ones in a worried situation. Do you really want that? Honestly there should be no a reason for that to happen. Reason one you should not operate a vehicle and be on your phone.",0
"Also, you can prevent from getting tickets or from getting your license suspended. Getting a ticket for operating a vehicle and usage of cell phone is a waste of money, a phone call, message and social media can wait. Therefore, you do not want your license to be taking away. Having a license is very import, it's the main thing you need to drive, so if they take it away you will not be able to operate a vehicle. You must know your opportunities that you have, take advantage while you can. Do not make the simple mistake to get it taken away just because you are being on your phone and being caught over and over. Those are your rights that you have, and van be taken away.",0

So, you can act and understand that driving is a big responsibility. Avoid getting into an accident or tickets. You have rights, and they can be taken away in a matter of a second. After everything it is very dangerous to operate a vehicle while being on the phone, make the right decision, think about yourself and those around you.",0

"There are valid arguments to be made both for and against extending school hours. Supporters cite the benefits of giving students more time to develop their learning and practice the skills needed for academic success. In addition, proponents argue that having more time in school allows teachers to cover more content in greater depth, giving students the opportunity to delve more deeply into the topics they are learning about. On the other hand, detractors claim that longer school hours can be detrimental to students’ physical and mental health, ultimately leading to greater burnout and decreased academic achievement. ",1
"After giving careful consideration to the arguments on both sides, I believe that longer school hours should not be implemented. While having more time in school can provide students with opportunities to strengthen their academic skills, it can also be detrimental to their health and well-being. Studies have shown that when students have too little sleep and too much stress, their academic performance and motivation decreases. Furthermore, the mental and physical strain of extended school hours could be a contributing factor to the rising rates of anxiety and depression among teens. ",1
"Ultimately, I believe that the best way to ensure academic success is to provide students with a balanced education that puts their mental and physical health first. This could involve shorter school hours and more optional activities such as sports and art classes, as well as providing students with access to mental health support services. By providing students with these means of support and free choice, we can ensure that their academic performance and well-being are both prioritized.",1
"Dear Senate, it is evident that many people think electoral voting is the wrong thing to do. I think that we would use another method of voting like popular voting. I feel this way because the president that you might be voting for might win the popular vote but because he had lost the electoral vote he doesn't become president. Furthermore, I believe this is wrong because the president with the majority of vote by the U.S. should win, people should be able to decide who is president, and because I think it's wrong to not give the U.S. citizens what they want.",0
"Although electoral voting may seem good it's not because you don't really vote for your president that you want your voting for a slate of elector that pick the president they would rather have. In ""Source 2:The Indefensible Electoral College: Why even the best laid defense of the system are wrong"" it states that ""Under the electoral college system, voters vote not for the president, but for a slate of electors, who in turn elect the president"" From this we can see that its shouldn't be like this because the people should be able to choose the president who they voted for. Also in source 2 it states"" The single bets' argument against the electoral college is what we might call the disaster factor. The American people should consider themselves lucky that the 2000 fiasco was the biggest election crisis in a century the system allows for much worse. Consider that state legislatures are technically responsible for picking electors, and that those electors could always defy the will of the people."" This just show how bad electoral voting can get. So we need to change the way of voting before it gets out of hand.",0
"After reading the passage I see another problem that electoral voting causes, which is that electoral voting is unfair to the people of the United States. It states ""At the most basic level, the electoral college is unfair to voters. Because of the winnertakeall system in each state candidates don't spend time in states they know they have no chance of winning focusing only on the tight race in the ""swing"" states."" this just explain that candidate that know that they cannot win your states votes won't even bother to try.",0
"People might feel that electoral voting is the best way to vote because we've always used it, and because it restores some balance that me be needed with larger states. But their still wrong because electoral voting has caused many problems for us in the past and how don't we know it will not cause them in the future. That why we should change our way of voting.",0

"Social media has become an integral part of our daily lives, and its impact on society has been a topic of much debate. While some argue that social media has a significant impact on societal norms and values, others believe that its impact is limited. In my opinion, social media has had a profound impact on society, shaping our norms and values in various ways.",1
"One of the primary ways in which social media has influenced society is by changing the way we communicate. Social media platforms have made it easier for people to connect with each other, regardless of their geographical location. However, this has also led to a decline in face-to-face communication, which is essential for building strong relationships and social skills. Moreover, social media has given rise to a culture of instant gratification, where people expect immediate responses and are less likely to engage in meaningful conversations.",1
"Another significant impact of social media is its role in shaping our values and beliefs. Social media platforms are filled with curated content that often presents an idealized version of reality. This can lead to unrealistic expectations and a distorted view of the world, particularly among young people who are still forming their values and beliefs. For instance, the constant stream of images showcasing perfect bodies and beautiful lifestyles can lead to body dissatisfaction and low self-esteem.",1
"Furthermore, social media has also had a profound impact on our political discourse. Social media platforms have made it easier for people to access information and engage in political discussions. However, this has also led to the spread of misinformation and the amplification of extreme views. Social media algorithms often prioritize sensational content, which can lead to the normalization of conspiracy theories and hate speech. This has contributed to the polarization of society and has made it more challenging to find common ground and engage in constructive political discussions.",1
"In addition, social media has also had a significant impact on our mental health. Social media platforms are designed to be addictive, and people often find themselves spending hours scrolling through their feeds. This can lead to feelings of loneliness, anxiety, and depression. Moreover, the constant stream of notifications and the pressure to maintain a perfect online image can be overwhelming, particularly for young people who are still developing their coping mechanisms.",1
"In conclusion, social media has had a significant impact on societal norms and values. While it has made it easier for people to connect with each other and access information, it has also changed the way we communicate, shaped our values and beliefs, polarized our political discourse, and negatively impacted our mental health. It is essential for individuals and society as a whole to be aware of these impacts and to use social media responsibly. By being mindful of our social media use, we can ensure that it has a positive impact on our lives and on society as a whole.",1
"There are a few different ways to answer this question. The first way to answer this question is to say that it depends on the student. Some students learn better by understanding ideas and concepts, and some students learn better by learning facts. Another way to answer this question is to say that it is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts. This is because if students understand the ideas and concepts behind the facts, they will be able to remember the facts better. Additionally, if students understand the ideas and concepts behind the facts, they will be able to use the facts in different situations and contexts. Finally, if students understand the ideas and concepts behind the facts, they will be able to think critically and come up with their own ideas.",1
"Winston Churchill's famous phrase, ""Success is not final, failure is not fatal: it is the courage to continue that counts,"" emphasizes the importance of perseverance in the face of adversity. This means that success is not a destination, but rather a journey, and failure is a natural part of that journey. Failure is not a permanent setback, but rather an opportunity to learn and grow. It is the courage to continue despite the challenges and setbacks that we face along the way.",1
"Failure is an important element to consider in the pursuit of success because it helps us to identify areas where we need to improve and to develop resilience. When we fail, we are forced to confront our weaknesses and to find ways to overcome them. We also learn to be more adaptable and to handle unexpected challenges. Failure can create problems if we allow it to define us and to give up. However, if we use failure as a learning opportunity and as a motivation to work harder, we can turn it into a stepping stone towards success.",1
"There are many examples of how failure can lead to success. One such example is the story of Thomas Edison, who failed thousands of times before he finally invented the light bulb. Each failure brought him one step closer to success, as he learned from his mistakes and refined his design. Another example is the story of J.K. Rowling, who was rejected by multiple publishers before finally finding success with her Harry Potter series. Each rejection was a setback, but it also motivated her to keep writing and to improve her work.",1
"When facing failure, it is important to take the right steps in order to create a successful outcome. The first step is to acknowledge the failure and to learn from it. This means reflecting on what went wrong and identifying the areas where we need to improve. The second step is to set new goals and to develop a plan for achieving them. This means breaking down the goal into smaller, more manageable steps and identifying the resources and support that we need to succeed. The third step is to take action and to persevere, even in the face of setbacks and challenges. This means staying motivated and focused, and not giving up when things get tough.",1
"In conclusion, failure is an integral part of the success process. It helps us to identify areas where we need to improve and to develop resin",1
"I feel like best way is working with a group is great idea because you have the chances to meet new people you don't know and have little conventions with them while working on getting ideas and finding the right response for your work on what the teacher gave as a group. Well one good reason on why working with a group is a good idea my opinion is because by working in a group you can find different details on what the teacher given what to work on in a group y'all can bring up all the information y'all came with or got from the Internet and have argument about which one should be the best answer. Another reason on why is a good idea working with in a group it's an easy way to get a better garden as a group and working in a group is really fun you get to talk and use the computer sometimes the teachers let us use our phone, and we make like a little group chat for us to talk about the work she told us to do and share our answers on the group chat and see who agree with it or who don't, and we all got different reasons and at the end of the day we pick the support detail and use it. My benefits of working with a group is that if you are one of them students who really want to be in a group and help people and on there work show them how smart you are and that you in the group of people you are a hard worker.",0
"First impressions are an essential aspect of human interaction. They are the initial judgments that people make about each other based on their appearance, behavior, and demeanor. These judgments can be influenced by a variety of factors, including personal experiences, cultural background, and social norms. However, the impact of first impressions can differ from person to person, and they can be modified over time.",1
"For example, consider a situation where two people meet for the first time at a job interview. One person may make a positive first impression by being friendly, confident, and well-prepared, while the other person may make a negative first impression by being nervous, disorganized, and unprofessional. The impact of these first impressions on the hiring decision may differ depending on the personal values and beliefs of the interviewer.",1
"Similarly, the impact of first impressions can differ in social situations. For instance, in a group of friends, one person may make a positive first impression by being outgoing, funny, and charismatic, while another person may make a negative first impression by being quiet, reserved, and unapproachable. The impact of these first impressions on the group dynamics may differ depending on the personalities and preferences of the individuals involved.",1
"However, first impressions are not set in stone, and they can be modified over time. For example, if the person who made a negative first impression in the job interview continues to demonstrate their skills and abilities, they may eventually make a positive impression on the hiring manager. Similarly, if the person who made a negative first impression in the group of friends continues to engage with the group and demonstrate their positive qualities, they may eventually make a positive impression on their peers.",1
"In conclusion, the impact of first impressions can differ from person to person, and they can be modified over time. It is important to recognize that first impressions are not always accurate and can be influenced by a variety of factors. Therefore, it is essential to be aware of our own biases and assumptions when forming first impressions and to be open to modifying them based on new information and experiences.",1

I think we should all be required to do at least 3 hours of community service. It would be a great way for everyone to get involved in their community and help others. It looks good if you have community service on your college application. This can help you with your life goals and make you a better person.,0
"We can tell the students about this in a way that makes it sound exciting like giving examples which makes it easier. We could say,' you can clean up trash in your neighborhood with your friends'. This might make it sound more exciting if you say you can do it with a friend. They can also help out at a daycare or assisted living center with their friends too.",0
"Some kids say that they don't have time to do community service, but they can make time. We can explain to them how they can complete their homework, do sports and other things and still do community service. We can give them tips on how to manage time and be responsible. I hope you take this letter into consideration.",0

If your answer is yes we would like you to come and sign up for The United Relief and Rehabilitation Administration. It's for Seagoing Cowboys that are willing to take care of horses, young cows, and mules that are shipped overseas.",0
"When you go through the process of going on the trip, don't get nervous. Luke Merger was a confident man to go on his journey with his best friend and was never really afraid. Every time you ride on that boat you feel a more live, which is a good thing. All you have to do is believe in yourself and you can do anything! Taking care of animals is another thing to, if you absolutely love animals than of course you might want to join. Especially if you are a farmer boy.",0
"Going on the journey made Luke feel alive, and it should make you feel alive if you think you are going to join the club that takes you overseas. I know all the men loved to go on that trip to take care of many farm animals, especially if you do that your everyday life. When Luke was on that trip he loved it, he first(1st) went to New Orleans for the trip. They got there the day the Pacific war ended, on August 14th. On his first (1st) trip the crew he was with ended up with 335 horses on the cargo, and had enough to feed everyone including the men on the ship.",0
"The story of Luke Merger is probably not urging you yet, but when Luke was official 18 he knew that he could join military. Then he thought I still love seagoing trips, so I'm going to stick with it, so he did. Do you see how motivated Luke was to join the Club of UNRWA? Luke already taken a total of nine(9) trips, and he was proud of it. Luke couldn't imagine his life without the trips he wouldn't have gone on, so he stayed on going with it, and he was confident in his choice.",0
"Not just that but Luke got to visit other countries such as China and European countries, such as Venice, Italy. He also got to help people all over the world. He was so proud of what he did and so full of joy. Luke once got hurt on one (1) of his journeys. While Luke was checking on the animals on a very rainy night he slipped and fell but lucky there was a small piece of metal that protected Luke from flying off the deck into the Atlantic Ocean, but thanks to that small piece of metal he was saved.",0

"Extracurricular activities are an important part of a student's life. They provide opportunities for students to develop new skills, socialize with peers, and contribute to their communities. However, there are also potential drawbacks to participating in extracurricular activities. In this essay, I will discuss the pros and cons of students participating in extracurricular activities and provide three real-life examples to support my ideas.",1
"One of the main advantages of participating in extracurricular activities is that they provide opportunities for students to develop new skills. For example, being part of a school debate team can help students develop critical thinking and public speaking skills. Similarly, being part of a school science club can help students develop scientific knowledge and experimentation skills. These skills can be valuable in many areas of life, including future careers.",1
"Another advantage of participating in extracurricular activities is that they provide opportunities for socialization. Being part of a school club or team can help students meet new people and form lasting friendships. For example, being part of a school sports team can help students develop teamwork and communication skills, as well as provide a sense of belonging and community.",1
"However, there are also potential drawbacks to participating in extracurricular activities. One of the main disadvantages is that they can take up a lot of time. For example, being part of a school debate team can require a significant amount of time for practices, meetings, and competitions. This can be challenging for students who have other commitments, such as homework or family responsibilities.",1
"Another disadvantage of participating in extracurricular activities is that they can be stressful. For example, being part of a school science club can be challenging for students who are not naturally inclined towards science. Similarly, being part of a school sports team can be stressful for students who are not naturally athletic. This can lead to feelings of anxiety and burnout.",1
"In conclusion, participating in extracurricular activities can have both advantages and disadvantages. On the one hand, they provide opportunities for students to develop new skills and socialize with peers. On the other hand, they can take up a lot of time and be stressful. Ultimately, it is up to each individual student to decide whether the benefits of participating in extracurricular activities outweigh the",1
"Summer vacation has long been a staple of the school system. Every year, students look forward to the break from school before the start of summer. However, recent disputes have been raised over the benefits, or lack thereof, of this extended break. Research has shown that taking short breaks throughout the school year that range from a few days to a week or more can increase student engagement and retention, as well as give students a much-needed mental break from school. While a longer summer break may be more appealing to students for leisure, the shorter breaks throughout the school year could be beneficial in the long run. On the other hand, there are other benefits to having a longer summer with one being the ability to reset and recharge for the upcoming school year. ",1
"Overall, it appears that having a longer summer break could provide more benefits than drawbacks. While short breaks can be advantageous during the school year, it is often more beneficial for students to have a long break to rest and prepare for the next school year. Therefore, keeping the length of the summer break the same seems to be the most beneficial decision for students.",1
" Car ownership is a major contributor to greenhouse gas emissions, and many countries are now implementing policies to reduce car usage. One such policy is the creation of car-free zones, where residents are encouraged to walk, bike, or use public transportation instead of driving. This approach has several advantages, including reducing air pollution, improving public health, and promoting sustainable transportation.",1
"One example of a car-free zone is the German suburb of Vauban, which was completed in 2006. In this suburb, street parking, driveways, and home garages are generally forbidden, and residents are encouraged to use public transportation or alternative modes of transportation. As a result, 70% of Vauban's families do not own cars, and 57% sold a car to move here. This has led to a significant reduction in greenhouse gas emissions, as cars are responsible for 12% of emissions in Europe and up to 50% in some car-intensive areas in the United States.",1
"Another example of a car-free zone is Paris, which enforced a partial driving ban in 2014 due to high levels of smog. This ban resulted in a 60% reduction in congestion in the city, and the smog cleared enough for the ban to be lifted. Delivery companies and exceptions were made for plug-in cars, hybrids, and cars carrying three or more passengers. This approach has several advantages, including reducing air pollution and improving public health.",1
"In Bogotá, Colombia, a car-free day is held annually, where residents are encouraged to walk, bike, or use public transportation instead of driving. This event has seen a significant increase in participation, with over 7 million people participating in 2019. This approach has several advantages, including reducing air pollution, improving public health, and promoting sustainable transportation.",1
"However, some may argue that car ownership is necessary for certain jobs or activities, such as delivery or transportation of goods. While this may be true, there are alternative modes of transportation available, such as electric vehicles or bicycles, which can be used for certain tasks. Additionally, many cities are now implementing bike-sharing programs and improving public transportation infrastructure to make alternative modes of transportation more accessible.",1
"In conclusion, limiting car usage has several advantages, including reducing air pollution, improving public health, and promoting sustainable transportation. While car ownership may be necessary for certain jobs or activities, there are alternative modes of transportation available, and many cities are now implementing policies to make alternative modes of transportation more accessible. By reducing car usage, we can work towards a more sustainable future and reduce our impact on the environment.",1
"The voters of America do not vote for a president; they vote for a slate of electors who then elect a president. The Electoral College is the process of voters relying on a slate of electors to vote for the presidential candidate of their choice, though they cannot always guarantee who the electors will vote for. The Electoral College should be changed to election by popular vote for the president because it is a non-democratic method since voters do not get to vote for a president directly, even though the outcome is almost always in the favor of the voter.",0
"The Electoral College is a non-democratic method of voting because voters only get to vote for a slate of electors, not the president of their choice. Although it is rare for an elector to vote for the president that is not the first choice of the people who elected him, it has happened. The Electoral College is also unfair because in the system, the ""winner takes all"". This is unfair because nominees only spend their time campaigning in the ""swing states"" that will get them the most votes. In these states, some voters know they have no chance of getting the president they wish to elect if the majority of the state chooses to elect the other candidate.",0
The Electoral College is an unfair way of voting because citizens do not have a voice in their election; can only hope that their elector votes for the president of their choice. Our Senator should change to election by popular vote so that every citizen may have a vote!,0
"In the modern world, young people are often criticized for not giving enough time to helping their communities. While this may be true in some cases, I believe that many young people are actively engaged in various community service activities. In this essay, I will argue that young people do, in fact, contribute significantly to their communities and that this contribution is essential for the betterment of society.",1
"Firstly, young people are often involved in volunteer work, which is a significant form of community service. Many young people volunteer at local charities, hospitals, and schools, where they provide valuable services to the community. For example, they may help to organize events, provide support to those in need, or assist with fundraising efforts. These activities are essential for building stronger communities and improving the lives of those who live in them.",1
"Secondly, young people are often at the forefront of social and environmental activism. They are passionate about issues such as climate change, social justice, and human rights, and they work tirelessly to raise awareness and effect change. For instance, young people have been instrumental in organizing protests, marches, and rallies to raise awareness about issues such as gun control, police brutality, and racial inequality. They have also been active in promoting sustainability and reducing waste by participating in initiatives such as beach cleanups and tree planting campaigns.",1
"Finally, young people are often involved in mentoring and tutoring programs, which are critical for the development of future generations. Many young people volunteer their time to help children and teenagers with their studies, providing them with the support and guidance they need to succeed. These programs are essential for building stronger communities and ensuring that young people have the skills and knowledge they need to succeed in life.",1
"In conclusion, while it is true that some young people may not give enough time to helping their communities, I believe that the majority of young people are actively engaged in various community service activities. They volunteer their time, participate in social and environmental activism, and mentor and tutor younger generations. These contributions are essential for building stronger communities and improving the lives of those who live in them. Therefore, it is essential to recognize and support the efforts of young people in their communities.",1
"Dear State Senator, 12315 I have a very strongly worded, persuasive letter written for you today of why our united nation, must abolish the electoral college. I am aware that the electoral college is one of the main ways' president's become elected, but it's serving an injustice to our nations people. You must do something of the crisis that our country is facing with the Electoral College. I have two compelling reasons of why the electoral college should be abolished.",0
"My first reason of why we should abolish the electoral college is because of the method it is done in. What I mean by this is, according to Source 1:What is the Electoral College?, it says, ""Most states have a ""winner take all"" system that awards electors to the winning presidential candidate."" The winner take all system is not a fair way to elect a president because of its biases. The candidates running for the presidency only visit the largely populated states in order to get their electoral points, for instance, most candidates go to California or Texas because those are the states that have for electoral points. But, by doing this all the smaller states that have less electoral points are never visited by the candidates, the voters then may have never seen an ad or campaign for a certain candidate. According to Source 2: ""The Indefensible Electoral College: Why even the best laid defenses of the system are wrong"", by Bradford Plummer, it states, ""During the 2000 campaign, seventeen states didn't see the candidates at all, including Rhode Island and South Carolina, and votes in 25 of the media markets didn't get to see a single campaign ad"". On the contrary, it is stated by Source 3: In defense of the Electoral College, it states,"" No region has enough electoral votes to elect a president."" This is true, but candidates focus on larger states that will supply them with more electoral votes, and don't even visit or pay any attention the smaller states. I strongly negate the Electoral College.",0
"My second reason of why our country must abolish the Electoral College is because it is a ""disaster factor"", as stated by Source 2. I agree with this for two reasons. First, because it does allow the people to vote for the president or candidate they prefer. Under the electoral college system, voters vote not for the president, but slate of electors, who turn elect the president, as stated by ""The Indefensible Electoral College: Why even the best laid defenses of the system are wrong"". I strongly agree with that except from the article I have stated. Another reason, why the Electoral college is a disaster factor is because most of the United States citizens prefer a direct election to the kind we have now, Electoral College. More precisely 60 percent of voters to don't want the electoral college, that's majority of our population! If the majority of our nation is against the electoral college why haven't we abolished it?",0
"In conclusion, ""It's official: The electoral college is unfair, outdated, and irrational. The best arguments in favor of it are mostly operations without much basis in reality"", according to Source 2. I would like you to consider all the problems our nation is facing due to the Electoral College. I have stated two contentions of why you should abolish the Electoral College First, the method of how its done is very bias and unfair and secondly, because the Electoral College is a ""Disaster Factor"" or causes many disruptions in our country.",0
"Degree certificates are widely recognized as a measure of one's academic achievements and knowledge. However, if this tendency goes to the extreme, young people may be misled into believing that a degree certificate is the only factor that determines their success in life.",1
"To begin with, a degree certificate is not a reliable indicator of one's ability to perform in the workplace. It is true that a degree certificate can demonstrate one's academic achievements, but it cannot reflect one's practical skills, such as problem-solving, communication, and teamwork. These skills are essential for success in the workplace, and they cannot be acquired through academic studies alone. For example, a person who has a degree in engineering may not be able to perform well in the workplace if he or she lacks the necessary practical skills.",1
"Furthermore, a degree certificate does not guarantee success in life. It is true that having a degree can open doors to many opportunities, but it does not guarantee success. A person may have a degree, but he or she may still fail to achieve success due to other factors, such as lack of experience, poor networking skills, or lack of motivation. For example, a person who has a degree in business may not be able to find a job if he or she lacks the necessary experience or networking skills.",1
"In conclusion, while a degree certificate can be a useful indicator of one's academic achievements, it is not the only factor that determines one's success in life. A degree certificate cannot reflect one's practical skills or guarantee success in life. Therefore, young people should not be misled into believing that a degree certificate is the only factor that determines their success in life.",1
"This passage is about the residents, congress and other people and groups in the U.S. government. It also tells us how Presidents are picked and when it is electing time. So in this essay I'm going to tell you what all happens in the court system such as how presidents get choose, thus the time that presidents are choose. Also, I will be telling what else there is in the government",0
"In the United States we have a president and how president is in charge of the country and what happens. He or she is in charge of what happens in other countries that can deal or harm us. So far in history we have had 44 presidents. Some presidents have done a lot more for this country than others have. Presidents are choose every four years by voting. The people that live in the country vote out of dozens of people who nominate themselves as president. Then they narrow down to 2 people, and they count the votes from there and that is how the presidents get choose",0
"There are other people in the government other than the president. There are political parties. Also, candidates. They both have different jobs in the court system. They aren't as high up in the court system as then president is but there help the president in what they do.",0
"I think that education is a life-long process. There are many reasons for this, but the main one is that education is a never-ending process. As long as you are learning, you are progressing. This is especially true when it comes to learning new things.",1

"Have you ever wondered why we, American people don't get to choose our electors? I always ask my self that question and never know why. In my opinion I think that the election should be by popular vote by the American citizens. The electoral college should be abolished because it is unfair to voters and irrational.",0

There have been many mistakes and disasters in the previous years. In the same article it says ""over sixty percent of the vote would prefer a direct election over the one we have now"". This proves that I'm not the only one who disagrees on the electoral college.",0
"It makes sense why people will actually like the electoral college. Considering that it is an easier way for us to vote and takes less time. However, a direct election really gives us the freedom that American people deserve. What is the point of voting for a president when you don't have the freedom to vote for the one you want?  ",0
"As time goes by, many technological advances come about and many change the world we live in. Within a few years there have been many new inventions that have completely revolutionized the way we live. Some people like the new ideas that are brought up and some don't. It all depends on who has a purpose to use it. The idea of cars that can drive themselves have come up and have some scratching their heads. Many do not want to have one of these cars and the developers are trying to find ways to improve them. As they continue to test them and see if they are ready to be sold to the public, the public can only wait and see how this will turn out.",0
"Vehicles have been improved year by year and there always seems to be a new model that comes out and is said to be the 'best' that has ever been made. The people want them and no matter what, there are always some things that bug the owners. As new models come out, the prices of the vehicles go up. Just imagine the price of a new car that is able to drive itself. We have no idea how the cars will affect our everyday life and what changes it will bring as well. I personally believe that these brand-new cars will not be a good thing to have. It could cause anger, and we could only imagine the price to get one repaired if it were to be in some sort of accident. With a slow limited speed, it would cause the other drivers on the road who drive normal cars to be very aggravated. The weather also brings up a new con in the public's mind as we wonder how the car will run in something such as snow or heavy rain. The car is drives itself until it reaches things like moving past an accident and moving through work zones. It may have the driver bored out of their mind, waiting for their turn on the wheel and has people wondering if others are able to be in the car with them. Could the car cause accidents and will be available to all who are able to afford it? There are so many new ideas that can have positive and very negative affects.",0
"There are still many questions that stay in our heads that we want to be answered. The car still has some time until it is publically released, but we are all anxious to see what this vehicle will do to our lives.  ",0

"I believe that the first policy is the better one to allow. I think that the first policy is better because kids should be able to have there phones just in case of emergency. Furthermore, I also think kids should have there phones because if you're at lunch you should be able to use you're phoned. And the last reason I think the first policy is better is that you can IOUs them for math.",0
The first reason think you should be able to have your phone in school is in case of and emergency. For example if you have to catch the bus home. Another example is if you have to go to a friends house. And lastly is because your parents might need to contact you.,0
"My second reason I think that the first policy is better is because if you're going to be at lunch or free time you're not going to be doing any work. For example, you can play a game on your phone. Another example is you can text your friends that might be on the other side of the lunchroom. And the last example is so that you can make a phone call",0
The last reason that I think that the first policy is better is because you could use them for math. For example if you need to use the calculator. Another example is so that you can put your notes that you take in class and put them in your phone. The last example is so that you can play with is when you're done your test.,0
As you can see I clearly believe that the first policy is better than the second policy.,0
"The author supports the idea that studying Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers by giving us an idea of what NASA is working on to get around the danger, giving us reasons why Venus is a sister planet to the Earth, and by showing us some key items that we could research. Venus is the closest planet to Earth in density and size. It is often referred to as Earth's twin because of this. However, there are some dangers to exploring the planet more in depth.",0
"The author states, ""Long ago, Venus was probably covered largely with oceans and could have supported various forms of life, just like Earth today."" The author put this piece of information in to show that we should do more research to show that life once existed on Venus. This planet could hold forms of life, but we don't have any research to prove it. Going to Venus, despite the dangers, would give us more evidence or materials to prove that Venus is even more or less similar to Earth, This would also help us understand our solar system more as a whole.",0
"The author states, ""NASA has one particularly compelling idea for sending humans to study Venus. NASA's possible solution to the hostile conditions on the surface of Venus would allow scientists to float above the fray. Imagine a blimp-like vehicle hovering 30 or so miles above the roiling Venusian landscape."" The author put this piece of information in to prove that NASA is trying to come up with possible solutions to explore Venus. However, they aren't working out so well as a vehicle like this would prevent them from collecting any rocks or gases to bring back and research. Studying Venus could lead to an abundance of solar power and the radiation would be minimal.",0
"The vehicle NASA is planning will not allow researchers to take samples of rocks, gas, or anything else or that matter. The author states, ""Peering at Venus from a ship orbiting or hovering safely far above the planet can provide only limited insight on ground conditions because most forms of light cannot penetrate the dense atmosphere, rendering standard forms of photography and videography ineffective. More importantly, researchers cannot take samples of rock, gas, or anything else, from a distance."" This is to explain that the dangers of going to Venus far outweigh the safety. There is lots of research to still be done on Venus.",0

"I am writing a letter to you because I want to talk to you about what I think our school should do about having community service. I think that having community service should be put into school because it's good for high school as a credit, helps the earth environment, and makes the school go green about things.",0
"When we all go to high school they want us to enter the school with community service done so that we help the community more and to have it as a credit. For example : we can attend and help the old people at a resting home or help at a local library to show that we have done our hours for school and that we have dedicated to something by helping the community. Teachers would probably like that quality in a kid, so they would put you in a advanced class since they see that you are smart and dedicated to do something as you are told to do so.",0
"Doing community service can also help the earth. Our earth has been going threw a difficult time because of the oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico and doing some community service can help it a lot. Like going to the beach and picking up the garbage left on the sand, or picking up trash left on the streets stuff like that would be perfect. Our global warming is getting awful and doing community service shows that you care for the earth, and you are willing to do something to save it.",0
"Also, when doing all of this community service the school will be known as a going green school. We can have recycled paper and bottles to show that we go green for the earth and so that we try to cut down on killing trees. Having all of this may make the school more popular because parents would want that since its better for there child education and learning process for their kids to know more about the community, our planet earth, and how to help it in many ways.",0
"Well thank you for your time, I hope that you take this opportunity and try it because doing so can really make a difference for the environment, community, and the school.",0

I would agree with keeping the Electoral College because it's a fair way to elect the President of the United States. The Electoral College consists of 538 electors the majority only 270 votes is required for the final decision. Each candidate running for the president has his or her own group of electors but the state law vary show many are selected. The presidential election is held every four Pearson the Tuesday after the first Monday of November.,0
The states are called districts for example the word state also refers to the district of Columbia. You can help choose your states electors when you vote for president. Even though you're voting for your candidate you're really voting for the candidates electors. Most states have a winner takes all system that awards all electors to the winning presidential candidate.,0
After the presidential election your governor prepares a certificate of ascertainment listing all of your candidates who ran for president in your state. The Certificate of Ascertainment also declares the winning presidential candidate in your state at the meeting of the electors in December. Then the certificate is sent to the congress and the national records of the presidential election.  ,0
"Many people are in belief of evaporating the idea of having the Electoral college. A Gallop poll taken in 2000 shows that citizens would rather have a direct election. As a member of the United States you must think of all the possibilities. Yes, the electoral college was once a great process, but now there are some changes are in need of being made.",0
"The electoral college is a process in which we select electors. This long and dragged out procedure is many steps that take months to prepare for. First, there must be a selection of the electors which are chosen by the states. Then the meeting must be planed and taken place. Who and why is a hard aspect to decide on voting day for those who have been chosen to be the electors. Votes for president and Vice President must be made. After voting the counting beings. The Electoral College has a total of 538 members. Over 270 votes must be made to elect the President. This process can easily be shortened by using a direct election.",0
By having a direct election everyone's voice is heard. This means less arguing in the states. Citizens enjoying believing their thoughts are not being avoided. Having the Electoral College taking place is highly unwanted in the US. This is because the people believe a direct vote is more efficient way for them to show who they believe is worthy of being President and Vice President.,0
Each candidate running for office retains a group of electors from a state. These electors are normally chosen by the candidate's political party. This means if a person doesn't like the electors chosen they feel like they still don't have a say of what is going on in the presidential election.,0
"In conclusion, The Electoral College is no longer a process citizens enjoy. This procedure is too long and citizens don't encourage it. Many people believe that this branch of government feels they will lose more power if the Electoral College is given up on. Using a direct election will spare the arguments and will allow us to have an easy and manageable process in which to vote on our leading man.",0
"The college now has votes for vice president and there are 538 electors, but 270 electors are what we are suppose to have 3 were picked by the state they have a president election for very for years if you run for president you get your own group, and you get a lot of responsibilities, and it is held very Tuesday and first Monday and the winner takes it all, and they have other candidates to worried about and the governor prepares for the president election and there are about 60% of voters if you the president you need to defined your title back in the 1960's in Louisiana we almost succeeded, but then they hired other electors to go against John F Kennedy and then everybody was faithless and now there are 500,000 voters, and it has increased drastic and we half to make a congress if your president 35,000,000 go to just pick a president 41,971 are in deadlock in 1976 there were about 5,559 elections back then there are 25,000 media markets' Texas had the most voters in 1987 and all of are presidents have at least 2,000 or more candidates bush had the least votes since 1888 61.5% of votes was compared to a voting percentage of 51.3% and that was in the north and south 2012 they have boosted their companies and their attention by ads and some build boards 29 electoral votes 3 were passed through there were 301 votes now there are 370 votes and this all happened in 1992 and there are more Democrats in Texas than there are in Florida there are 20 in Florida and 33 in Texas and all the elections are nationwide and voters do half of the work for just voting and the people are going through the votes to see hew there new president is for the new year and all the votes came from Electron college and all the campaigns are in the small states and in Texas they have turned off votes in Texas and now there is less attention in the company, and they do political votes and the people think that the voters should be the ones to decide the election and up state voters pay close attention to see hew wins.",0
"When it comes to important matters in life, seeking guidance from experts and authorities can be a valuable resource. However, there are also potential drawbacks to relying solely on the opinions of others. In this essay, I will analyze the pros and cons of seeking guidance from experts and authorities for important matters in life.",1
"One of the main advantages of seeking guidance from experts is that they have a wealth of knowledge and experience that can be valuable in making informed decisions. Experts can provide insights and perspectives that may not be immediately obvious to the average person, and can help individuals navigate complex issues with greater ease. Additionally, experts can often provide guidance on how to avoid common mistakes and pitfalls, which can save time and resources in the long run.",1
"However, there are also potential drawbacks to relying solely on the opinions of experts. For example, experts may not always have a complete understanding of the individual's unique circumstances and needs. This can lead to incorrect advice or recommendations that may not be the best fit for the individual. Additionally, experts may be biased or have a vested interest in certain outcomes, which can lead to conflicts of interest and potential harm to the individual.",1
"Another potential disadvantage of seeking guidance from experts is that it can lead to a lack of personal growth and development. When individuals rely too heavily on the opinions of others, they may not take the time to think critically and make decisions based on their own values and beliefs. This can lead to a lack of complete understanding of one's life, and can make it difficult to navigate complex issues in the future.",1
"On the other hand, making mistakes can be a valuable learning experience. When individuals make mistakes, they have the opportunity to reflect on what went wrong and learn from their experiences. This can help individuals develop critical thinking skills and become more resilient in the face of challenges. Additionally, making mistakes can lead to personal growth and development, as individuals learn to take responsibility for their actions and make better decisions in the future.",1
"In conclusion, seeking guidance from experts and authorities can be a valuable resource for important matters in life. However, it is important to be aware of the potential drawbacks and to approach guidance with a critical eye. By considering the pros and cons of seeking guidance, individuals can make informed decisions that balance the need for expertise with the importance of personal growth and development.",1
I think that using the Facial Action Coding System in schools is a great idea.,0
Teachers always want to know if you understand the lessons and objectives they are teaching you.,0
If you're anything like me then you will just act like you know what's going on because you don't want to ask any questions.,0
"The use of the Facial Action Coding System in classes would be valuable because it would help show the teachers if the students understand what they are being taught, it would help the students understand each others emotions, and since most schools have technology the system could show how they are feeling on their devices as well.",0
If teachers had the Facial Action Coding System device on hand they could easily see how the students are feeling about a particular lesson.,0
This would work well for the students that don't share their opinions in the classroom or at all.,0
If students did not understand a lesson the emotion reading device could show the teacher how the students are feeling.,0
"If the device shows students are confused or bored, the teacher could modify the lesson to better the students and increase their knowledge capacity and possibly make it more entertaining.",0
The technology could also help the teenagers express how they truly feel because some teenagers are hard to read.,0
"Some teens, like myself, have a resting face that makes me look angry at the world and unapproachable.",0
I think a device like this would show that some peers are not as angry or upset as their resting face shows.,0
"Also, most communication takes place over technology nowadays.",0
"Personally, my school has laptops and I think it would be great if the software was on our devices because emotions play a huge role in everyone's lives.",0
This software would also help numerous school guidance counselors across the globe because they deal with all sorts of emotions every day.,0
"I know some of my peers do not enjoy sharing emotions or their opinions on certain situations with people they are not familiar with, and I am the exact same way, but if you are in harms way and still will not express what is going on then this device would be extremely helpful.",0
The technology has the intelligence to identify mixed emotions which is helpful because most people have trouble perceiving facial traits and expressions.,0
"If my school had this software, I would be all over it trying to find out how I feel because sometimes I don't even know my own emotions.",0
"The use of the Facial Action Coding System in classes would be valuable because it would help show the teachers if the students understand what they are being taught, it would help the students understand each others emotions, and since most schools have technology the system could show how they are feeling on their devices as well.",0
"I think using the Facial Action Coding System software on our school computers is brilliant idea, and I personally think my peers would test it out in a heartbeat.",0
There are numerous benefits and positive outcomes from using this software in a classroom. ,0
"Drivers cars are coming! Google cofounder Sergey Brin envisions a future with a public transportation system. He envisions fleets of diverless cars form a public-transport system. He believes such cars would fundamentally change the world. Although everything seems good, there are some bad things about these cars too. Questions like who would be responsible if they crash, what happens when dealing with complicated traffic or road construction. Driverless cars is it really a good thing?",0
"Driverless cars may act all good but are the really? Driverless cars would put way too many jobs out the window, taxi services, truck driving services, limo services they would all lose their jobs. Everyone would be out of work. They would all get replaced by technology. We would have a big unemployment rate. How do you know they might not malfunction and crash, you are putting your live and everyone in the cars' life on the line too. The cars can steer, accelerate, and brake themselves, but still need human skills.",0
"Traffic laws are written with the assumption that the only safe car has a human driver in control at all times. Many states will not test computer-driven cars for safety reasons. If the technology fails and someone is injured, who is at fault? The car, the car should have the newest technology to drive anywhere and to be safe. Releases for a car capable of driving on autopilot 90 percent of the time. What happens to the other 10? These cars aren't safe.",0
"Driverless cars good or bad thing? Cars without drivers is a bad thing. So many things can go wrong the technology can fail anything. This is why we have laws to say it is only safe for a human driver to be driving at all times. People who make them will need a lot of responsibility to make these cars not have any problems, so they don't ruin lives.  ",0
Experiments and new ideas are paving the way for new cultural changes. Cars are emitting more and more pollution every year. Researchers and studies show that by limiting the use of motorized vehicles the harmful gases trapped inside the ozone will eventually diminish.,0
"In Vauban, Germany they have given up theirs cars. ""Street parking, driveways and home garages are generally forbidden in THS experimental new district"" says Elisabeth Rosenthal. According to the article, 70 percent of Vauban's families do not even own a car, and 57 percent sold their car just so they could move into this suburban lifestyle.",0
"Paris, France decided to give this experiment a try. After five days France recorded that 60 percent of the capitals' congestion went down. This has made more clear skies and easier breathing habits for residents.",0
"The United States is now thinking about trying this new change. Researches say that since the recession not many people are buying cars nowadays. They don't have a need for them as much as they did before. Numbers have been going down steadily since 2005.

"With this new cultural shift, it could be better for people, industries and most importantly the air we breathe!  ",0
"Nowadays, many people can see lots of advertisements. Some of them are good, some are bad, but most of the time, the advertisements are not very good. The reason for this is that most people do not know how to evaluate the quality of an advertisement. They just see the advertisement and think that it is good or bad. This is not a good way to make a decision. If you want to know the truth, you have to do some research. You need to find out what the advertiser is trying to sell you, and what you are willing to pay for it. In this article, I am going to show you how you can do just that.",1
"How to Evaluate the Quality of a Product Advertisements are a very effective way of getting people to buy a product. However, they can also be very misleading. For example, if you see an ad that says that a new car will save you a lot of money in the long run, do you really think you will buy it? Of course not. Most people would not be able to afford such a car even if it was offered at a low price. So, what is the point of advertising? The point is to get people interested in buying the product and to convince them that they will be happy with it once they have it in their hands. Unfortunately, this does not always work. Sometimes, people just don't like the idea of buying something that is too good to be true. That is why you should always do your research before you buy anything. Here are some tips to help you make an informed decision: 1. Read the fine print. 2. Look at the pictures. 3. Check the warranty. 4. Ask for a price comparison. 5. Make sure you understand the terms and conditions. 6. Don't be afraid to ask questions. 7. Do your homework. 8. Take a look at other people's reviews. 9. Compare the price of similar products. 10. Try to compare the features of different brands. 11. Find out how long the manufacturer has been in business. 12. Learn about the company's history. 13. Get a feel for the brand's reputation. 14. See if there are any complaints about it on the Internet. 15. Talk to your friends and family. 16",1
I think that students should be allowed to bring there phones to school and use them at free times. I believe This is a good idea because kids don't have anything to do and their would more than likely get themselves in trouble for doing something they would not have if they had something to do. Also what if there is a family problem like if somehow the house went up in flame the kid who lived in that house would know before other people. Or what if the school was on fire the kid would than be able to call the mom or dad and let them know that the kid is okay. Another reason that it is a good idea is because kids tend to listen more when they are happy and phone to say something to your friend across the lunchroom is a grate way to keep the kid happy for the rest of the day. On the other hand the kids might be to in to the phone to tern it off for class if this happens a teacher can take it away from the kids that are not following the rules of the school. So I say we should have phones in school just not during class. Thank you for listening to what I had to say about the phone debate that our school is having. I hope you see that having phone in school is a great idea and plan.,0
"Many people believe that the face on Mars was created by aliens. These people are called theorist. Theorist are people who give accusations without any supportive details.

"I'm here to tell you that is not true, as you may know the most recent pictures from 1998 and 2001 you may see the images a little clearer, and you are able to see the surrounding ground of the''face'', so if there was any alien activity or any alien structures down their I'm pretty sure we would see it.

"As the world becomes more accessible, the number of travel options available to us is increasing. From solo travel to group tours led by a tour guide, there are many ways to explore the world. While some may argue that traveling alone is the best way to experience new cultures, I believe that traveling in a group led by a tour guide is the best way to travel. In this essay, I will explain why I believe this to be true.",1
"Firstly, traveling in a group led by a tour guide is a great way to meet new people. When you travel alone, you are limited to the people you meet along the way. However, when you travel in a group, you have the opportunity to meet people from all over the world who share your passion for travel. This can lead to lifelong friendships and connections that you would not have made otherwise.",1
"Secondly, traveling in a group led by a tour guide can be safer than traveling alone. When you are in a foreign country, it can be easy to get lost or find yourself in an unsafe situation. However, when you are part of a group led by a tour guide, you have someone who knows the area and can help you navigate any potential dangers. Additionally, tour guides are often trained in first aid and can provide assistance in case of an emergency.",1
"Thirdly, traveling in a group led by a tour guide can be more efficient than traveling alone. When you travel alone, you are responsible for planning your itinerary, booking your accommodations, and navigating your way around a new city or country. This can be time-consuming and stressful. However, when you travel in a group led by a tour guide, many of these details are taken care of for you. This allows you to focus on enjoying your trip and experiencing new things.",1
"Finally, traveling in a group led by a tour guide can provide you with a more immersive cultural experience. Tour guides are often locals who know the area well and can provide you with insights into the local culture that you would not have otherwise.
