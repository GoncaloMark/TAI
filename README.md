### Copy Model

## Overview

## Features

## How to use

This section contains steps that one can use to get their own copy of our programs.

- firstly, fork this repository using the fork button on the top right corner of the page to get your own copy of the repository. This is to ensure that you can actively experiment with the code of the project.

- secondly, once you have the fork, you can clone the repository to your local machine using the following command:

```bash
git clone <paste URL of the forked repo here>
```

- thirdly, once you have cloned the repository, you can navigate to the directory of the repository and run the following command to compile the code:
    For cpm:

    ```bash
    make cpm
    ```

    For mutate:

    ```bash
    make mutate
    ```

    Remember to get chry.txt

This will create the executables by compiling and linking the project. We can now test and run the appropriate shell script in there to test the programs.

- **Note:** The use of a Linux based system is recommended.

- **Note:** To run the programs on a windows system, you can use the windows subsystem for linux (WSL2).
